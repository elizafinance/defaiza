In a DAO, members interaction is mediated by software agents running on a blockchain that encode the governance of the specific entity in terms of rules that optimize their business and goals. In this context, most popular DAO software frameworks provide decision-making models aiming to facilitate digital governance and the collaboration among their members intertwining social and economic concerns. However, these models are complex, not interoperab",
    "le among them and lack a common understanding and shared knowledge concerning DAOs, as well as the computational semantics needed to enable automated validation, simulation or execution. Thus, this paper presents an ontology (Web3-DAO), which can support machine-readable digital governance of DAOs adding semantics to their decision-making models. The proposed ontology captures the domain logic that allows the sharing of updated information and decisions for all the members that interact with a DAO by the interoperability of their own assessment and decision tools. Furthermore, the ontology detects semantic ambiguities, uncertainties and contradictions. The Web3-DAO ontology is available in open access at https://github.com/Grasi a/semantic-web3-dao. \n\n**1. Introduction** \n\nThe proliferation of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) in recent years [1,2] and the announcement of the first DAO officially registered in Wyoming [3], affording the same rights as a Limited Liability Co",
    "mpany (LLC) [4], has raised significantly the interest among the industry, the academic and the public debate as a means to harness the potential of blockchain technology for supporting digital governance in a participative and non-hierarchical way. The term DAO started to appear in the context of decentralized solutions with the creation of Ethereum [5]. The ability to encode rules in terms of “smart contracts” (i.e., software agents representing pieces of software deployed on a blockchain and executed in a decentralized and automated way) allowed users to explore new online governance and business models, avoiding the centralized middlemen or intermediaries [6]. In a DAO, all its members, who are supposed to have common interests and goals, can participate in the decision-making process associated with relevant issues concerning the organization such as selecting proposals, solutions or strategies, profit distribution or smart contract \n\n update for modification of business processes",
    ". This is made through a voting system, which is implemented as a decentralized application (Dapp). Integrating individual social relations with economic aspects using blockchain technology is very challenging and brings many advantages, for example, participative decision-making and complete transparency in the process. Indeed, involving all the members in the decision-making process empowers them to contribute to the management and success of the organization, making it more productive and competitive [7]. However, due to the inherent complexity and ambiguity of DAOs and blockchain governance, this potential has not been fully explored. That is, the concept is still under development and lacks a common understanding, making the adoption and launch of DAOs a hard task to tackle, and not only because of technological concerns [8,9]. This complexity was shown in the first DAO that attracted widespread attention: a venture capital fund confusingly called “The DAO” [10]. This open-source ",
    "project attracted 11,000 investors and $150 M, where the funds were operated by the implemented code, theoretically safe from managerial corruption. However, a bug in that code enabled vulnerabilities that were exploited by an attacker who withdrew $50 M, \n\n * Corresponding author. E-mail address: mcvaliente@ucm.es (M.-C.

This short lived experiment showed how deploying a confusing implementation of DAO governance rules may trigger awful consequences. The frameworks that nowadays provide support for the creation and management of DAOs are mainly limited to two key references, Aragon [11] and Daohaus [12], each of them providing their specific d",
    "ecision-making models, which are not easy to manage for all DAO members, essentially because of their lack of experience addressing the issues of voting processes in organizations using blockchain technology such as wallet management and transaction signing. Further, these models lack computational semantics and interoperability capabilities that enable a shared understanding and knowledge that could support further development of specific decision and assessment systems in a DAO. On the other hand, since these frameworks only exploit the Ethereum blockchain, where transactions have a direct cost for their users, most members choose to use other cheaper specific blockchains known as “sidechains” (e.g., Gnosis Chain [13]) or to use off-chain applications that have no cost in order to communicate their selection in a decision-making process [14]. These external tools for voting are not interoperable with the decision-making system provided by the DAO and, therefore, a member must manuall",
    "y notify the final result in the DAO. In this vein, this paper addresses the analysis of governance in DAOs by means of the creation of an ontology (Web3-DAO) that formalizes the knowledge of the existing approaches provided by the most popular DAO frameworks. The Web3-DAO ontology captures the main concepts of making-decision processes in decentralized organizations. To illustrate this approach, we build a knowledge graph that encodes knowledge data captured by the ontology. Tools to analyze such knowledge graphs allow to: (i) integrate knowledge provided by ontologies from different sources; (ii) learn patterns and compact representations; (iii) reason over hidden structures for new knowledge inference; (iv) build data products such as Application Programming Interfaces (APIs); and (v) communicate with other systems. The aims of the proposed ontology is: (i) to build scalable domain conceptual models of the decision-making systems associated with DAOs, avoiding semantic ambiguities, ",
    "uncertainties and contradictions; (ii) to enable the automated generation of the high-level software requirements of interoperable decision-making systems concerning digital governance in DAOs; (iii) to improve the understanding, sharing, interchange and reusability of concepts concerning DAOs by automated means; (iv) to provide a mechanism that can be extended with new concepts in a well-defined manner and infer new knowledge that can be incorporated into the knowledge base; (v) to enable the formal specification of blockchain platform-agnostic DAOs; and (vi) to help bridging the gap between blockchain technology and human interaction. The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 covers the background on DAOs, collaborative decision-making, and semantic knowledge representation. Related work is presented in Section 3. Section 4 describes our methodology to define the ontology on the basis of the decision-making process for DAOs. It also presents the main classes and prop",
    "erties of the proposed ontology. Finally, Section 5 draws some conclusions and outlines future work. \n\n**2. Background** \n\nIn this section we describe background information and fundamental issues regarding DAOs, decision-making systems and ontologies. \n\n_2.1. Blockchain_ \n\nBlockchain can be described as a distributed database that stores transactions grouped into blocks generating a decentralized public digital ledger [15]. The blocks represent the history of the blockchain and the \n\n transactions change its state. Since blockchain generated ledger is timestamped, all the transactions are verifiable and traceable. That is, all computers on the network can validate every single transaction. Transactions are chosen and ordered in each block depending on a specific consensus algorithm (i.e., a synchronization mechanism for maintaining consistency across each copy of the database replicated in a trustless peer-to-peer network). Thanks to its consensus algorithm, which removes the need for",
    " trust in a central authority, the crypto-economic incentives available to verify the authenticity of transactions, and immutable data recorded in the network that cannot be changed, blockchain technology could be a good alternative for the design and implementation of auditable and decentralized e-government models in organizations and markets ensuring security [16]. Bitcoin was the first blockchain used as a new form of decentralized electronic payment using a digital currency (i.e., cryptocurrency) called “bitcoin” [17]. Through Bitcoin, for example, blockchain users can send or receive funds in bitcoins. \n\n 2.2. DAOs \n\n Aiming to move beyond Bitcoin’s cryptocurrency applications, Vitalik Buterin created a new platform based on blockchain technology, known as Ethereum [5]. With this, it introduced the concept of decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) as a way to explore those new organizations’ governance rules, which could be automated and transparently embedded in a blockchai",
    "n in terms of building blocks known as smart contracts [18]. Since then, DAOs have been discussed in Economics, Law, Organization Theory or Computer Science as a means to support digital governance on decentralized organizations based on blockchain technology. Currently there are two decentralized organizations deployed using blockchain technology that could be considered as de facto references in the DAO ecosystem, MolochDAO [19] and Aragon DAO [11]. Furthermore, an extensive analysis and detailed information of each DAO on this ecosystem can be found in DeepDAO [2]. However, there is not yet a widely accepted definition of the DAO concept and different approaches contribute to add confusion and ambiguity in this complex domain [8]. For example, to present but a few, Dhillon et al. [20] defines it as “ a blockchain entity built on a consensus of decisions by its members ”, Beck et al. [21] as “a decentralized, transparent, and secure system for operation and governance among independe",
    "nt participants” which “can run autonomously” and Hassan [22] as “a decentralized organization which can provide services (or resources) to third-parties or even hire people to perform specific tasks. Hence, individuals can transact with a DAO in order to access its services, or get paid for their contributions”. That is, as remarked in Aragon [23,24], a DAO can be understood in terms of smart contracts (i.e., software agents built on open-source software embedded in a blockchain) that implement the logic of the organization, or in terms of the members that participate in a collective way in the organization to pursue common goals without a central authority or validator (i.e., eliminating the need for trust in other parties). Therefore, although we could state that a DAO represents a software application (i.e., a Dapp) that operates autonomously, different meanings of the term, the lack of semantics of its use, and many other aspects, make it very difficult for many interested entitie",
    "s or communities to understand, integrate and launch DAOs. \n\n 2.3. Collaborative decision-making \n\n Decision-making is a critical process for any organization, aimed at achieving goals, thus being successful and increasing motivation among its members at the same time. To this purpose, good decision-making normally includes collaborative decision-making. \n\n\nWhat the industry makes clear is that member participation or empowerment in decision-making takes advantage of their ideas and knowledge to contribute to the success, renewal and transformation of the organization with a good performance in a democratic way [25,26]. In a DAO, decision-making is carried out by all their members as a virtual community through proposals and a voting infrastructure, which is part of the software system that implements a specific DAO. Through a predefined voting protocol such as voting majority [27], members of a DAO state their preferences using voting right items, known as tokens that allow them to pa",
    "rticipate in the process. \n\n_2.4. Ontologies_ \n\nOntologies are mostly used in the context of distributed computing environments for understanding, sharing and reuse knowledge among people or software agents about some domain of interest to improve interoperability (i.e., they include machine-interpretable definitions). An ontology can be defined as a formal and explicit representation of a shared conceptualization [28,29]. The term “shared” indicates that an ontology captures some consensual knowledge about a specific domain of discourse (i.e., the real-world), and the term “conceptualization” means an abstract, simplified view of that domain. This definition can be refined by understanding an ontology as a formal vocabulary with a specific meaning of the real-world and the related set of assumptions about that meaning [30]. In general ontologies are composed of three main components: \n\n (i) Classes: sets of individuals (i.e., instances) with similar properties in the domain under stud",
    "y. (ii) Datatype properties: links that connect an individual to a specific datatype. For example, a RDF literal such as a string or an integer. (iii) Object properties: links that connect an individual to an individual (i.e., relationships between two instances of classes). \n\nOntologies can be represented adopting different standards such as _Resource Description Framework Schema_ ( _RDF Schema_ ) [31] and the _OWL 2 Web Ontology Language_ [32], which is an extension of RDF and _RDF Schema_ enabling integration with a variety of tools using the _Extensible Markup Language_ (XML) as interchange syntax. In addition, OWL 2 ontologies enable the definition of property domains, cardinality ranges and reasoning rules at a class, property or instance level. \n\n**3. Related work** \n\nTo the best of our knowledge, such ontology for DAOs has not been proposed among those related to the blockchain-based decentralized application area [33]. However, in recent years there has been some research base",
    "d on ontologies for representing knowledge of specific blockchain contexts. For example, Cantone et al. [34] describe how to leverage the Ontology for Agents, Systems, and Integration of Services (OASIS) [35] as a general means for the formal representation of smart contracts. On the other hand, Bella et al. [36,37] extend the previous paper in order to represent the Ethereum blockchain, and the smart contracts deployed on it. In this case, the authors focus their work in the representation of the ERC721 standard for _Non-Fungible Tokens_ (NFTs) management [38]. In the context of DAOs, Pe˜na-Calvin et al. [39] propose a categorization scheme for DAOs based on a qualitative analysis of DAOs implemented through the Aragon platform [11]. In their work, the authors develop a coding scheme consisting of several descriptive dimensions depending on three different perspectives: (i) general aspects of DAOs; (ii) aspects of the DAOS’ voting processes; and (ii) tokens used in DAOs. However, all ",
    "the DAO semantics is expressed using natural language, and as the authors explain, the findings found in their work are limited to the Aragon platform and, therefore, must be interpreted within this context. Using an OWL 2 ontology, our approach captures all \n\n the issues associated with blockchain platform-agnostic DAOs, enabling users to focus on and reuse specific DAO implementations and to obtain automated reasoning. Lastly, Ziegler and Welpe [40] propose a data-driven taxonomy that describes the different forms of DAOs. In this case, using the natural language too, the authors devise a coding scheme that consists of three main categories (Community, Governance and Treasury) divided into sub-categories, dimensions and characteristics, which generates five semantically different types of DAOs: (i) investment-focused DAOS; (ii) networking-focused community DAOs; (iii) off-chain product and service DAOs with community focus; (iv) off-chain product and service DAOs with investor focus;",
    " and (v) on-chain product and service DAOs. \n\n**4. Web3-dao: an ontology for representing a semantic model for DAOs** \n\n In this section we present Web3-DAO, an approach to building an ontology for DAOs, which is based on the current most popular DAO frameworks (Aragon, Daohaus), the corresponding facto references in the DAO ecosystem (Aragon DAO, MolochDAO), as well as complementary sources associated with the DAO domain such as Ethereum. The proposed ontology is defined by using OWL 2 DL, the Description Logics (DL) [41] sublanguage of OWL 2 [32] that enable more expressiveness such as the definition of classes in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions (i.e., equivalent classes); and conducted using the open-source Prot´eg´e tool [42]. Furthermore, ontologies described using OWL 2 DL can be processed by a reasoner where the ontology class hierarchy can be computed automatically detecting inconsistent classes. The result, the Web3-DAO ontology, counts 79 classes with 91 object p",
    "roperties and 40 datatype properties. As mentioned earlier, since a DAO can be specified in terms of the members that are part of the organization, it is worth highlighting that some of the ontology concepts have been defined in terms of another existing ontology, Friend of a Friend (FOAF) [43], a widely-used vocabulary that gather terms related to the description of people, their interests, relationships and activities. The use of upper ontologies such as FOAF enables a clear separation of the different DAO concerns and improves the understanding and reusability of the proposed ontology. From here on, we use the prefixes “foaf” and “dao” to refer to the namespaces of FOAF and Web3-DAO respectively. The methodology used for the development of the proposed ontology follows the methodology proposed by Uschold and King in [44] for Ontology Engineering. The implementation of the ontology is composed of three tasks that have to be accomplished for a valid formalization of the domain knowled",
    "ge: (i) the identification of the concepts and the relationships between those concepts; (ii) the representation of that shared conceptualization (i.e., concepts and relationships) in a formal language; and (iii) the integration of existing ontologies which can improve domain knowledge. We use the Unified Modeling Language (UML) [45] to present the proposed ontology in a graphical way. In this vein, UML classes represent OWL 2 classes, UML associations correspond to object properties, UML attributes represent datatype properties, and UML inheritance is used for subclass. \n\n 4.1. Web3-DAO purpose \n\n The complexity of DAOs is still a challenging problem in the evolution of Web3. For example, according to the literature, tokens can be classified as security tokens and utility tokens. In this context, Weston [46] states that voting rights are provided by utility tokens, but Anwar [47] states that security tokens are the tokens that offer voting rights. But, can both utility tokens and secu",
    "rity tokens provide voting rights? What kind of token could provide voting rights? What are the different \n\n\ncategories for tokens? What tokens should be included in a decision-making process according to its category? Therefore, the ontology must be able to include, describe and relate all the required elements which are part of the creation and management of DAOs including the mechanisms to model decision-making processes and the corresponding voting results. \n\n_4.2. Web3-DAO principles_ \n\nThe semantic model for DAOs proposed in this work is based on the structure illustrated in Fig. 1, which relies on seven main concepts ( _Blockchain, DAO, Dapp, Member, Proposal, SmartContract, WebUserInterface_ ) and the nine relations defined among them. Each of them focusing on a separate aspect of the domain in which we are interested. A _DAO_ is a _Dapp_ built on a main smart contract, with a _web user interface_ (i.e., a front-end). _Smart contracts_ are _deployed on_ a _blockchain_. Addition",
    "al _Dapps_ known as _auxiliary contracts_ can support a DAO. In turn, a _DAO_ is _governed by members. Members_ can _create proposals_ and can _vote_ for _proposals_. In order to further detail the most relevant concepts related to the Web3-DAO principles, some formal definitions are included next. \n\n### Definition 1. A Blockchain is defined as a tuple b = { η, T , Θ , s, Y , Ω , Ψ} \n\n### where η represents a peer-to-peer (P2P) network that connects users and \n\nstores transactions grouped into blocks; T represents the set of transactions that change the state of a blockchain; Θ represents the set of consensus rules that formalize transactions and validate state transactions; _s_ represents a state machine that manages transactions following the consensus rules; Y is the set of blocks that represents the history of a blockchain; Ωrepresents the native token (i.e., cryptocurrency) associated with a blockchain, such bitcoin (BTC) on the Bitcoin blockchain or Ether (ETH) on the Ethereum bl",
    "ockchain; and Ψ is the set of open source software applications (i.e., clients) that implement a blockchain, in such a way that they can communicate with each other over the P2P network. \n\n### Definition 2. A smart contract is defined as a tuple σ = { m, A , B , b } \n\nwhere _m_ is the piece of software that provides the functionality required to implement a set of business rules (e.g., a governance model) and execute it autonomously, without requiring a trusted third part, in a decentralized way; A is the set of auxiliary smart contracts that provides support to the development of that functionality; B is the set of rules that encodes the business logic of a governance model; and _b_ represents a blockchain where the software application _m_ is deployed on. \n\n### Definition 3. A Dapp is defined as a tuple α = { σ, I} where σ is the \n\nmain smart contract that represents it; and I represents a web user interface that enables the interaction between a Dapp and its users. \n\n### Definition ",
    "4. A DAO is defined as a tuple δ = {K , ω, α, X , H , P , Δ} \n\n where K is the token that an organization will mint during its creation process as a DAO. That is, the minting process will generate a new token without the involvement of a central authority that will be used by a \n\n### DAO to raise funds, provide voting rights or fill its treasury; ω is the \n\n cryptocurrency wallet that manages DAO tokens enabling DAO mem\n\n### bers to pursue their common goals such as a business or charity [23]; α is \n\n the Dapp implemented as open-source software that represents a DAO; X represents the set of committees that sets up the DAO. Committees are composed of the members of the DAO; H represents the set of stakeholders interested in the DAO. Stakeholders may include customers, employees, shareholders, etc.; P represents the set of proposals associated with the DAO as part of the decision-making processes; and Δ represents the set of Dapps that provides support to a DAO such as a voting system o",
    "r a finance system. \n\n Definition 5. Let M j = \n\n#### { \n\n m 1 j, m 2 j, … , mnj \n\n#### } \n\n be the finite set of members of a DAO δ in a specific committee xj , with M j ⊂ xj and xj ∈ X. Each member mij actually represents an Externally Owned Account (EOA) neither person nor organization. An EOA is an online account managed by an individual or organization that has a private key which is used to control funds and smart contracts. To be a member of a DAO, an EOA must be part of at least one or more committees that set up a DAO. \n\n Definition 6. A proposal pi ∈ P represents a plan or suggestion by a question, especially a formal or written one, put forward for consideration or discussion by one or more committees of a DAO. Only members of a DAO can be responsible for proposals and only authorized committees associated with a proposal can vote for taking decisions (e.g., distributing funds or implementing new business rules). \n\n Fig. 2 illustrates a general overview of the semantic model",
    " defined by the Web3-DAO Ontology using a UML class diagram. For reasons of space, the complete Web3-DAO ontology is neither depicted nor described in detail. The complete Web3-DAO ontology can be accessed at https://github.com/Grasia/semantic-web3-dao. The rest of this section will present a closer look at the most important concepts represented in Fig. 2. \n\n 4.3. Agents \n\n A foaf:Agent is the super class for all concrete agent types that constitute the underlying Web3-DAO model. We use this class to classify the concepts related to the DAO domain that are considered agents. In FOAF, agents represent things that do stuff. This class has three main subclasses: (i) foaf:Group : a collection of individual agents, (ii) foaf:Organization : a kind of foaf:Agent corresponding to social institutions such as companies, societies, etc.; and (iii) foaf:Person : people, but it does not specify about their state (e.g., alive, dead, real, or imaginary). On the \n\n Fig. 1. Web3-DAO principles. \n\n\noth",
    "er hand, this class has two main object properties: (i) _foaf:account_ : a _foaf:OnlineAccount_ held by a _foaf:Agent_ ; and (ii) _foaf:member_ this property relates a _foaf:Group_ to a _foaf:Agent_ that is a member of that group. In our approach, we have added the next subclasses: (i) _dao:Blockchain_ : a distributed database that is updated and shared across several computers in a network (see Definition 1 in Section 4.2); (ii) _dao:Dapp_ : a decentralized application that combines a _dao:SmartContract_ and a frontend ( _dao:WebUserInterface_ ) (see Definition 3 in Section 4.2); (iii) _dao: Network_ : different _dao:Blockchain_ environments that can be accessed for development, testing of production uses cases; (iv) _dao:OpenSourceSoftware_ : code developed in a decentralized and collaborative way that is designed to be publicly accessible, and relying on peer review and community production; (v) _dao:Oracle_ : off-chain application known as the oracle node that sources, verifies, an",
    "d transmits external information (i.e., information stored off-chain) to a _dao:SmartContract_ running on a _dao:Blockchain_ ; (vi) _dao:OracleContract_ : the on-chain component for the oracle service that listens for data requests from a _dao:SmartContract_ , relays data queries to oracle nodes, and broadcasts returned data to the client contract; (vii) _dao:SmartContract_ : a program that runs on a _dao: Blockchain_ (see Definition 2 on Section 4.2); (viii) _dao:Web3Wallet_ : a \n\n web3 wallet that helps to manage blockchain accounts and store digital assets such as cryptocurrency and NFTs; and (ix) dao:WebUserInterface : front-end code written in any programming language which allows users to make calls to a dao:SmartContract running on a dao:Blockchain through a Web browser. The dao:DAO concept is a foaf:Agent defined as a software application that represents an online community that jointly manages a web3 wallet to pursue common goals (see Definition 4 in Section 4.2). In this cont",
    "ext, a dao:DAO is a subclass of dao:Dapp, dao:OpenSourceSoftware and dao: Organization. Besides, a dao:DAO is composed of one or more dao:Committee and needs a dao:DAOAgreement that acts like a constitution. Although a dao:DAO has its own dao:SecurityToken , it can support other types of tokens. A DAO is represented in the Web3-DAO Ontology following the schema illustrated in Fig. 3. A dao:DAO has been further divided into different specializations: (i) dao:CollectorDAO: entity that pools funds together so that the collective community can invest treasury funds; (ii) dao:GrantDAO: entity that facilitates nonprofit donations throughout the Web3 ecosystem; (iii) dao:InvestmentDAO: entity that pools funds to invest in early stage Web3 startups, protocols and other investments not available in traditional \n\n Fig. 2. High-level view of the Web3-DAO ontology. \n\n\nfinance; (iv) _dao:MediaDAO:_ entity that creates content driven by the collective community in such a way that individuals earn a ",
    "piece of the DAO profit; (v) _dao:PhilanthropyDAO:_ entity that creates impact in the Web3 ecosystem focused on social responsibility; (vi) _dao:ProtocolDAO:_ entity that governs decentralized protocols such as decentralized exchange; (vii) _dao:SocialDAO:_ entity that creates communities that can be self-organized by the participation of like-minded individuals such as artists and creatives; and (viii) _dao:SubDAO:_ new kind of DAO that represents a subset of DAO members in order to provide mechanisms for specific services affecting the DAO such as grants and marketing. \n\n_4.4. Online accounts_ \n\nThe _foaf:OnlineAccount_ concept is defined as an online service provided by some party to a _foaf:Agent_. This class has a name property, _foaf: accountName_ , which is used as an identifier, and two main object properties: (i) f _oaf:account_ : an account held by a _foaf:Agent_ ; and (ii) _foaf: AccountServiceHomePage_ : homepage of the service provider for this online account. In this cont",
    "ext, we use this class to classify the different types of accounts related to DAOs: _dao:ContractAccount_ and _dao:EOA_. A _dao:ContractAccount_ represents the address associated with a _dao:_ \n\n SmartContract (see Definition 2 in Section 4.2.), which is generated when a smart contract and, consequently, a DAO is deployed on a specific blockchain network. This address enables applications and users to interact with a specific smart contract and invoke its methods via transactions. Further, this address can act as the identifier of a specific DAO. As mentioned in Section 4.2., a dao:EOA stands for Externally Owned Account , and represents the address that can access specific blockchain networks and run smart contracts (see Definition 5 in Section 4.2.). In this context, a dao:EOA also represents DAO members or stakeholders interested in a DAO, but are not members of that DAO. Fig. 4 illustrates the representation of online accounts in the Web3-DAO ontology. It is worth noting that the d",
    "ao:Holds, dao:IsMember and dao:Votes classes in the Web3-DAO ontology have been used to model the association classes between the next classes: (i) dao:EOA and dao:Token ; (ii) dao:EOA and dao:Committee ; and (iii) dao:EOA and dao:Proposal. The rules for transforming UML class diagrams to OWL ontologies have been taken from the method provided by M. H. L. Vo and Q. Hoang [48]. \n\n 4.5. Projects \n\n A foaf:Project is defined as “a collective endeavour of some kind”. \n\n Fig. 3. The structure of a DAO in the Web3-DAO ontology. \n\n\nThat is, it represents the class of things that are seen as ‘projects’. In the Web3-DAO ontology, _dao:Proposal_ is defined as a subclass of _foaf:Project_ and represents the idea that stakeholders can send a proposal to a DAO for its evaluation in order to implement it in that DAO (see Definition 6 in Section 4.2.). Not only members can post proposals, although, in this context, a proposal must have a responsible member that guarantees it. A _dao:Proposal_ is comp",
    "osed of a _dao:Question_ to consider from an idea that implies change and transformation in a DAO; and a document, _dao: ProposalDocument_ , that describes: (i) the idea; (ii) the implementation process; and (iii) the required funding for performing it [49]. Specific committees which are part of the DAO will be responsible for making a decision through a voting process. It is worth noting that a _doa:delegateKey_ is the _dao:EOA_ that has received delegated shares from another DAO member in order to vote. A _dao:Proposal_ is the super class of all the concrete proposal types defined in the Web3-DAO ontology: (i) _dao:Elections_ : wallet permissions from the DAO; (ii) _dao:Financial_ : transference of any asset with monetary value from the DAO; and (iii) _dao:Others_ : changes to governance, code, parameters, etc. The representation of proposals is illustrated in Fig. 5. \n\n_4.6. Tokens and wallets_ \n\nA _dao:Token_ is an item that is managed by specific blockchains and it can represent a",
    "ssets, currency and voting rights, among others. Each _dao:Token_ is managed by a _dao:Web3Wallet_ , and each _dao:DAO_ instance must be the owner of a specific _dao:Token_ that represents the organization itself. _dao:FungibleToken_ and _dao:NonFungibleToken_ concepts are subclasses of _dao:Token_. A _dao:FungibleToken_ represents interchangeable assets (i.e., divisible and not unique) that can be used in our context, for instance, as money or in exchange for specific services provided by a DAO. Fungible tokens have been classified as either _dao:SecurityToken_ or _dao:UtilityToken_. A _dao:SecurityToken_ is a fungible governance token that provides financial rights such as voting and profit share. A _dao:SecurityToken_ is subject to regulations and securities; and represents tradable assets and \n\n investment contracts as determined by Howey Test (USA) [50] and the Directive 2014/65/EU (MiFID II) [51]. A dao:UtilityToken is a fungible unit of account on a specific blockchain enabling ",
    "access to services provided by DAOs stored in the corresponding blockchain. A dao:UtilityToken is not concerned about the company’s shares and it is exempted from regulations and securities. Besides, access to this type of token is not restricted. The dao:Cryptocurrency concept is a subclass of dao:UtilityToken representing native tokens whose transactions are secured and verified using cryptography over a blockchain such as, bitcoin on the Bitcoin blockchain and ether on the Ethereum blockchain. On the other hand, a dao:NonFungibleToken is a token that is cryptographically unique and distinct. In order to prove ownership of this type of token, each Non-Fungible Token, also known as NFT, is associated with a unique identifier and linked to a specific digital or physical asset. Finally, a dao:Web3Wallet is the facility aimed at helping users to manage blockchain accounts and store their tokens. A dao:Web3Wallet acts as the gateway to a blockchain and provides mechanisms for getting user",
    " account balance, managing user funds and sending transactions, among others. The dao:Web3HWWallet concept and the dao:Web3SWWallet concept are subclasses of dao:Web3Wallet. A dao:Web3HWWallet is a device that guarantees users keep their tokens offline in a secure manner. A dao:Web3HWWallet requires users to plug into a computer or online device to access their digital assets. Then, user tokens can be stored on a dao:Web3HWWallet instead of on online servers, which will no longer be used for storing them. A dao:Web3SWWallet is a dao:Dapp that enables users to interact with blockchain systems through a browser and a desktop application, among others. Besides, software wallets can provide mechanisms for hardware wallet support. Fig. 6 depicts the representation of tokens and wallets in the Web3-DAO ontology. \n\n Fig. 4.

Conclusions** \n\nIn this paper, we present a formalization in OWL 2 DL of the DAO ecosystem that facilitates entrepreneurs, DAO members, stakeholders and researchers a better understanding of this new type of online governance, as well as easing its implementation and management. Ontologies allow us to bridge the gap between the real-world data modeling concerning a DAO, and how these data have to be represented and stored in a blockchain in a formal and understandable way. This work captures the knowledge of blockchain governance in terms of DAOs for interoperability and enables to build domain conceptual models and add semantics and constraints to the data associated with the different decision-making processes that underpin a DAO. Therefore, different DAOs, and the corresponding decision-making systems that want to cooperate for exchanging information, can share and reuse this information in a homogeneous way. The benefits of this approach include",
    ": (i) the semantics and constraints associated with DAO management can be defined avoiding ambiguities and enabling a better and common understanding for the modeling, adoption and launch of DAOs; (ii) guidance to novice organizations who are less experienced and that have incomplete knowledge or misunderstanding of the DAO field; (iii) organizations can reduce costs when the DAO is implemented properly; and (iv) developers can provide the levels of capability, safety, quality and evolvability required by DAOs and implement Dapps that can better interpret all the information. However, though this approach is a very flexible way of developing and administrating DAOs, the disadvantage is that inconsistencies and failures that could appear as a consequence of the inevitable and logical evolution of this form of governance until it reaches an acceptable level of acceptance and maturity. Therefore, looking to the future, since the underlying blockchain technology involves continuous refinem",
    "ent, and the number of realworld implementations available for the DAO ecosystem is set to increase, we will update the Web3-DAO ontology to add new classes, object properties and data properties, as well as the definition of rules that provide mechanisms for inferring new knowledge ensuring interoperability of DAOs, on the basis of the experience and feedback gained from such progress. Also, we will set up a pilot project to keep the ontology up-to-date and implement evaluation tests. \n\n**CRediT authorship contribution statement** \n\n**María-Cruz Valiente:** Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Software, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review & editing. **Juan Pavon:** ´ Writing – original draft, Writing – review & editing. \n\n**Declaration of competing interest** \n\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the ",

How can they navigate the expected cyclical downturn? How can \n\nthey boost underlying potential growth that has slowed, especially since the global finan\n\ncial crisis? How should they adjust regulations and reform policies to benefit from the digi\n\ntal ",
    "revolution while mitigating the transition costs? This report summarizes the economic \n\noutlook for the region and examines the adoption of new blockchain technologies. In doing \n\nso, it touches on all three challenges. \n\nThe 2017 rates of growth of GDP (2.7 percent) and private consumption (2.5 percent) \n\nwere faster than at any time since the global financial crisis of a decade ago. Growth was \n\nespecially strong in Central Europe and in Turkey, but it was robust in other parts of the \n\nregion as well. Unemployment rates are now close to their 2007 levels in most countries, \n\nand average inflation exceeds 2 percent, indicating that little spare capacity is left. \n\nDeceleration of growth is expected to be modest, but a sharper correction remains pos\n\nsible. Cyclical forces can easily reinforce one another, and additional shocks—rising pro\n\ntectionism, geopolitical tensions, larger than expected disruptions caused by Brexit—could \n\nmaterialize. There is little room for further monetary",
    " stimulus if the expected slowdown is \n\nsharper than expected. The region has rebuilt some fiscal buffers, however. The average \n\nfiscal deficit in 2017 is estimated at just above 1 percent of GDP, down from 6 percent dur\n\ning the 2009 crisis and close to levels at the end of the boom that preceded that crisis. Fiscal \n\nstimulus is thus an option in several countries in case of a sharper than expected slow\n\ndown. Under the baseline scenario of only a modest deceleration, however, a further \n\nbuildup of fiscal buffers seems the best strategy. \n\nMany countries in the region have proven to be fertile ground for the development of \n\ncryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies. The emergence of these technologies is part \n\nof a broader wave of technologies that facilitate peer-to-peer (P2P) commerce, the indi\n\nvidualization of products, and the flexibilization of production methods. \n\nFor a variety of reasons, these trends gained traction after the global financial crisis a \n\ndecade ago. B",
    "lockchain technologies aim to organize P2P transactions and P2P informa\n\ntion flows without intermediaries and central banks have opportunities to use blockchain \n\ntechnologies to improve their services. \n\nIt is unclear how these technologies will develop in the long run; their ultimate impact \n\nmay be very different from the current applications. In response, policy makers should \n\nstrike a balance between curbing the hype surrounding these new technologies and un\n\nleashing potentially transformational new opportunities. While encouraging and facilitat\n\ning these innovations, they should prepare to craft new regulations to create a level playing \n\nfield for new and old industries, by adjusting financial oversight, consumer protection, \n\nand tax administration. They should also address the massive volume of electricity used \n\nto mine cryptocurrencies. \n\n### Executive Summary \n\n\n\n**PART** \n\n### Economic Outlook \n\n# I \n\n\n\n3 \n\n# 1 \n\n3 \n\nOverview \n\nGrowth is strong in Europe and Central As",
    "ia (ECA), stronger than at any time \n\nsince the global financial crisis of a decade ago. GDP rose 2.7 percent, and annual \n\nprivate consumption rose 2.5 percent. Growth was especially strong in Central \n\nEurope and Turkey, but it was robust in other parts of the region as well. \n\nGrowth has likely peaked, however. Increased capacity utilization, unemploy\n\nment rates close to their 2007 levels, and average inflation now exceeding 2 per\n\ncent are all signals that growth is likely to decelerate. \n\nThe peaking of growth raises several questions \n\n- How well is the region prepared for a sharper than expected cyclical down- \n\n turn? As fiscal deficits have fallen to an average 1.5 percent of GDP, fiscal policy could be used. But in most countries, monetary tightening would probably be more appropriate. \n\n- Why is the underlying structural growth so low? Growth in 2017 was 0.4 per- \n\n centage points below the average growth rate between 2000 and 2007. The decelerating growth trend is associat",
    "ed with the shift toward services, the decline in capital deepening, and a slower pace of measured total factor productivity (TFP). \n\n- Has the economic upswing been used to adjust to the new normal of digital \n\n technologies, more flexible employment contracts, and increased tradability of goods and services? An unfinished agenda remains in terms of rethinking social protection and facilitating private sector development in new, internationally competitive sectors. It is important that adjustments toward this new reality continue, even if the expected slowdown materializes or deepens. \n\n### Economic Developments \n\n### and Prospects \n\n\n4 ● World Bank ECA Economic Update May 2018 \n\nGrowth is strong throughout the region \n\n GDP growth of 2.7 percent in 2017 translated into a robust 2.5 percent increase in per capita GDP, as the population is growing at a mere 0.2 percent a year. This rate of growth was the fastest since 2007 and 0.9 percentage points faster than in 2016 (table 1.1). Grow",
    "th exceeded 4 percent in 20 of the 47 countries in the region. Ireland and Malta enjoyed growth of more than 5 percent. Romania and Slovenia in Central Europe; Armenia and Georgia in the South Caucasus; and Turkey, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan in Central Asia also reported strong growth. Azerbaijan, Belarus, and the Russian Federation emerged from recession (although their growth was only moderate). Not a single country in the region experienced a contraction in 2017. Private sector demand drove this vigorous performance. Government consumption increased by less than 1 percent on average in the region. Private investment rose by more than 4 percent, and growth in investment outpaced GDP growth for the fourth year in a row. The volume of exports and imports expanded by more than 5 percent in 2017, roughly twice as fast as GDP growth. 1 The acceleration of growth has been a global phenomenon. Since the summer of 2016, growth of global industrial production has more than doubled, approachin",
    "g 5 percent in recent months, very close to the 4.8 percent global growth during the 2003–07 boom. \n\nTABLE 1.1 Growth has reached an all-time high in most countries in Europe and Central Asia \n\n Annual GDP growth (percent) \n\n Change in forecast since October 2017 (percentage points) \n\n Region/subregion 2015 2016 \n\n 2017 (estimate) \n\n 2018 (forecast) \n\n 2019 (forecast) 2016 \n\n 2017 (estimate) \n\n 2018 (forecast) \n\n Europe and Central Asia 1.9 1.8 2.7 2.3 2.1 0.0 0.5 0.4 \n\n European Union and Western Balkans 2.2 1.9 2.5 2.2 1.9 0.0 0.4 0.4 \n\n European Union 2.2 1.9 2.5 2.2 1.9 0.0 0.4 0.4 \n\n Western Europe 2.2 1.8 2.3 2.1 1.7 0.0 0.4 0.4 \n\n Northern Europe 2.6 2.5 2.5 2.3 2.1 0.2 0.2 0.2 \n\n Central Europe 3.9 3.1 4.6 4.1 3.6 0.2 0.9 0.7 \n\n Southern Europe 1.6 1.7 2.2 1.9 1.6 0.0 0.3 0.3 \n\n Western Balkans 2.2 3.0 2.4 3.1 3.4 0.1 −0.3 −0.1 \n\n Eastern Europe and Central Asia 0.3 1.1 3.7 3.0 3.0 0.0 1.1 0.4 \n\n South Caucasus 1.7 −1.6 2.0 2.6 4.0 0.5 1.7 0.8 \n\n Central Asia 2.8 2.8 4.4 3.5 3.",

The region as a \n\nwhole outperformed the United States in 2017, and growth of industrial produc\n\ntion in Central Europe and Turkey was on par with growth in China and India. \n\nThis performance lies in sharp contrast to performance in the aftermath of the \n\nEuropean banking and debt crisis, when the region’s performance significantly \n\nlagged that of the world as a whole. \n\nDuring this global acceleration, commodity prices rebounded. Copper prices, \n\nwhich are closely linked to the industrial cycle, increased 43 percent between \n\nOctober 2016 and March 2018, more than any other commodity. Oil prices in\n\ncreased 30 percent over the same period (figure 1.2, panel a), providing som",
    "e \n\nrelief for energy exporters and recipients of remittances in the eastern part of the \n\nregion. Consistent with their strong relationship with energy prices, grain prices \n\nincreased 18 percent between October 2016 and March 2018. Other agricultural \n\nprices declined, leaving the index of agricultural prices flat. \n\nThe total nonoil commodity price index increased 10 percent over the last year \n\nand a half, largely reflecting the weakening of the U.S. dollar over that period, as \n\nall commodity prices are measured in dollars. The dollar depreciated 11 percent \n\nagainst the euro and 6 percent against the Chinese renminbi over this period. \n\nAverage commodity prices expressed in these two currencies were thus relatively \n\nstable. The dollar also depreciated against other currencies in the region. Between \n\nOctober 2016 and March 2018, it fell 16 percent against the Czech koruna, 14 \n\npercent against the Albanian lek and the Polish zloty, 9 percent against the Rus\n\nsian ruble and the H",
    "ungarian forint, 7 percent against the Romanian leu, and 3 \n\npercent against the Kazakh tenge. Only a few regional currencies depreciated \n\nduring this period against the dollar. The Turkish lira depreciated 27 percent, and \n\nthe Azeri manat depreciated 5 percent. Metal and oil prices increased in all cur\n\nrencies, and many other commodity prices declined in euros or other currencies \n\nin the region. \n\nDespite their cyclical upturn, oil prices are nowhere near their historical highs. \n\nIndeed, adjusted for inflation, global oil prices are 57 percent below their peak of \n\n \u001f3 \n\n \u001f2 \n\n \u001f1 \n\n 0 \n\n 1 \n\n 2 \n\n 3 \n\n 4 \n\n 5 \n\n 6 \n\n 2013M032013M092014M032014M092015M032015M092016M032016M092017M032017M092018M03 Percentage growth 3 months average \n\n over same period a year ago \n\n World Europe and Central Asia \n\nFIGURE 1.1 **Industrial** \n\n**production growth has** \n\n**soared since 2016,** \n\n**globally and in Europe** \n\n**and Central Asia** \n\n_Source:_ World Bank. \n\n\n6 ● World Bank ECA Economic Upd",

Consequently, adjustments in countries that directly or indirectly depend on oil exports should continue. Several of these countries have become more competitive in international markets and begun diversifying their economies, partly as a result of the depreciation of real exchange rates since the fall in oil prices late 2014. Unexploited opportunities remain to shift farther away from nontradable production. Domestic reforms that correct price distortions, eliminate privileges for state-sponsored companies, and unleash more competition and innovation remain essential. The recent wave of reforms in Uzbekistan sets a good example. 3 They will likely lead to further diversification and may trigger reforms in surrounding countries. \n\nFIGURE 1.2 **Commodity** \n\n**prices have followed** \n\n**the econ",

With less spare capacity, \n\nlower unemployment, rising inflation, and tightening monetary policy, the po\n\ntential for continued rapid growth has diminished, esp",
    "ecially in the ECA region. \n\nUnemployment is now close to where it was at the height of the boom a de\n\ncade ago (figure 1.3, panel a). The labor market has become tight, especially in \n\nNorthern Europe. The rapid decline in unemployment is remarkable, given the \n\nhistory of hysteresis in the region’s labor markets. After every major crisis, the \n\ntypical pattern in Europe was for unemployment rates to settle at higher levels. \n\nIt is especially encouraging that youth unemployment in the European Union \n\nhas fallen sharply. It is now back to 2005 levels (figure 1.3, panel b), having fallen \n\nFIGURE 1.3 **Acceleration of** \n\n**growth has resulted in** \n\n**lower unemployment** \n\n 0 \n\n 2 \n\n 4 \n\n 6 \n\n 8 \n\n 10 \n\n 12 \n\n 19901992199419961998200020022004200620082010201220142016 \n\n Unemployment rate (percent) \n\n 10 \n\n 15 \n\n 20 \n\n 25 \n\n 4 \n\n 6 \n\n 8 \n\n 10 \n\n 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016 \n\n Unemployment rate (percent) Unemployment rate (percent) \n\n Workers 25 and older (left-hand ax",

That is a critical change from the deflationary threats in the aftermath of the European banking crises. Between 2012 and 2016, the consumer price index declined in at last one year in Armenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, Georgia, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, the Slovak Republic, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland. In ",
    "several of these countries, the GDP deflator still rose, and the drop in consumer prices reflected terms-of-trade gains. Nevertheless, the deflationary threat was a serious concern and the manifestation of underutilized resources. None of these countries experienced deflation in 2017. The average inflation rate of 2 percent is close to the target of monetary authorities. As a result, the European Central Bank will likely discontinue quantitative easing in 2018; central banks outside the euro area are also expected to tighten their policies. Tightening has already started in Turkey, where inflation has reached double-digit levels. Asset prices have risen even faster than consumer prices (figure 1.5). The increase in real estate prices is not nearly as extreme as it was during the boom a decade ago, but in Northern Europe double-digit annual increases were not uncommon in 2017. This boom is an additional reason for monetary policy makers to raise interest rates. In the eastern part of th",
    "e region, monetary policies are likely to tighten in coming years, even as inflation has recently fallen (figure 1.4). High inflation in 2015 and 2016 was part of a one-time price adjustment after the fall in oil prices and the subsequent unavoidable depreciations of exchange rates. That adjustment \n\nFIGURE 1.4 **Normalization** \n\n**of inflation in Europe and** \n\n**Central Asia continues** \n\n \u001f1 \n\n 0 \n\n 1 \n\n 2 \n\n 3 \n\n 4 \n\n 5 \n\n 6 \n\n 7 \n\n 8 \n\n 9 \n\n 2013M012013M082014M032014M102015M052015M122016M072017M022017M092018M04 \n\n Eastern ECA Western ECA \n\n Percentage change over three-month \n\n average in previous year \n\n_Source:_ World Bank. _Note:_ Western ECA is the unweighted average of 29 countries: Albania, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxemburg, Latvia, Macedonia, the Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, the United",

Further inflation should now be controlled by central banks, \n\nwhich have to build their credibility with floating exchange rates. Now that oil \n\nprices are recovering, tighter monetary policies make sense, as they can allow \n\nhigher prices to be absorbed by appreciating currencies. \n\nTighter monetary policy and rising interest rates will restrain domestic growth \n\nand reduce capital flows to emerging economies. The capital flows that were \n\nsearching for yields in emerging economies when interest rates in high-income \n\ncountries were close to zero will likely decline, moderating growth in countries with \n\nlarge external funding needs. In such an environment, a cyclical downturn is more \n\nlikely than further accele",
    "ration or even stabilization of growth at current levels. \n\nThat slowdown may already be happening. The Purchasing Managers’ Index, \n\nwhich combines various indicators in the manufacturing sector (new orders, \n\ninventory levels, production, deliveries, employment), has fallen in the re\n\ngion since the beginning of 2018 (figure 1.6, panel a). The drop from the peak \n\nreached in the last six months was particularly large in France, Germany, Italy, \n\nTurkey, and the United Kingdom, even if the index was still above 50, indicat\n\ning growth (figure 1.6, panel b). \n\nThe coming cyclical downturn is expected to be modest, mainly because, with \n\nfew exceptions, there are no signs of overheating that require sharp corrections. \n\nInvestment ratios are still at balanced levels, and no steep declines in those ratios \n\nare expected. Inflation is at normal levels, and monetary tightening can be very \n\ngradual. GDP growth for the region is expected to fall from 2.7 percent in 2017 to \n\n2.3 percent in ",
    "2018 and 2.1 percent in 2019. \n\nThe expected slowdown is very similar for the eastern and western parts of \n\nthe region. However, there are marked differences between smaller subregions. \n\nIn the eastern part of the region, almost all the slowdown in growth is forecast to \n\ncome from Turkey, with a modest strengthening of growth in oil-exporting coun\n\ntries. In the western part of the region, the slowdown is expected to be rather \n\nevenly distributed among members of the European Union, and some accelera\n\ntion of growth is expected in the Western Balkans. \n\nFIGURE 1.5 **Housing prices** \n\n**in the European Union have** \n\n**risen since 2013** \n\n \u001f8 \n\n \u001f4 \n\n 0 \n\n 4 \n\n 8 \n\n 12 \n\n Annual percentage growth 2006Q12007Q22008Q32009Q4 2011Q12012Q22013Q32014Q4 2016Q12017Q2 \n\n Nominal housing prices Housing prices deflated with CPI \n\n_Sources:_ Data from Eurostat and the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. \n\n\n10 ● World Bank ECA Economic Update May 2018 \n\n Although there are good reasons to expect",
    " only a modest deceleration of growth, a sharper correction is possible. Cyclical forces can easily reinforce one another, and additional shocks—including rising protectionism, geopolitical tensions, and larger than expected disruptions from Brexit—could slow growth. Does the region have the capacity for countercyclical policies? There is no room for further monetary stimulus; at most, the expected monetary tightening could be delayed slightly. The region has rebuilt some fiscal buffers. The average fiscal deficit is estimated to have been just above 1 percent of GDP in 2017, down from 6 percent of GDP during the 2009 crisis; it is close to levels at the end of the boom that preceded that crisis (figure 1.7). Fiscal stimulus is thus an option in several countries in the event of a sharper than expected slowdown. Under the baseline scenario of only a modest deceleration, further buildup of fiscal buffers seems the best strategy. \n\nFIGURE 1.6 **The Purchasing** \n\n**Managers’ Index reache",

Did countries in the region \n\nuse the recovery to adjust the structure of their economies, to better equip them \n\nfor future challenges? Why has potential growth been ",
    "slower since the crisis than \n\nit was during the boom that preceded it? The rest of this chapter addresses these \n\nquestions. \n\nThe region has shifted toward more exports... \n\nThe biggest and most important adjustment during the recovery has been the \n\nshift of production capacity toward exports. Despite the slowdown in global \n\ntrade, the share of exports in GDP is now 10 percentage points higher than it was \n\nduring the 2000s (figure 1.8). This shift is important, because the economic struc\n\nture during the 2003–07 boom, when growth in many countries in the region was \n\ndriven largely by expansion of nontradable sectors, was no longer sustainable. \n\nDuring that boom, capital inflows, oil revenues, and inflows of remittances re\n\nsulted in increased domestic spending and a related loss in international com\n\npetitiveness. In the new normal after the crisis, all three forms of foreign inflows \n\nare more moderate. The change has created the opportunity to become more \n\ncompetitive in inte",
    "rnational markets while reducing investments in real estate \n\nand other nontradable sectors. \n\nImports have also increased as a share of GDP, albeit by less than exports. The \n\noverall current account surplus of the region has thus increased, largely because \n\nthe deficits that Central European countries financed with massive capital in\n\nflows during the boom have disappeared. These inflows came with a sharp de\n\ncline in investment ratios in those countries. \n\nThis adjustment is similar to the correction in East Asia after the 1998 financial \n\ncrisis (box 1.1). During the 1990s, emerging East Asian economies received large \n\ncapital inflows after they opened up to global markets, just as Central Europe did \n\nlater, during the 2000s. The reversal of capital flows in 1998 had similar effects on \n\nEast Asia as the 2008 crisis did on Central Europe. \n\nFIGURE 1.7 **Government** \n\n**deficits in the region have** \n\n**fallen sharply since 2009** \n\n \u001f7 \n\n \u001f6 \n\n \u001f5 \n\n \u001f4 \n\n \u001f3 \n\n \u001f2 \n\n \u001f1 \n\n 0 \n",

The analysis of how countries are adapting is beyond the scope of this chapter. Chapter 2 examines ECA’s involvement in some of these new technologies. In both regions, large current account deficits during the boom were financed with capital inflows that were reversed during the crisis. Emerging economies in East Asia received large capital inflows during the 1990s, after they opened their economies to global markets. Central European economies received large flows of foreign direct investmen",
    "t and other capital before and during their accession to the European Union. Their aggregate current account deficit widened to more than 8 percent of GDP in 2007. Heavy borrowing in foreign markets increased the vulnerability of both corporate and financial sectors to capital flow reversals (Truman 2013). In both cases, the reversal of capital inflows led to a steep and immediate decline in investment rates. In East Asia the loss in income was larger, so the immediate fall in investment rates was greater. Investments rates bounced back subsequently, but they remained below the preceding boom levels. \n\nA combination of factors caused the decline in labor \n\nproductivity after the crisis \n\n Growth in ECA returned to precrisis levels in 2017. It has not been strong enough to compensate for the production losses that have occurred since the crisis, however (figure 1.9). Moreover, as little spare capacity is left, it is unlikely that these losses can be recouped in the coming years. Thus no",

    "sector. 5 \n\n As the third component is numerically insignificant, analysis of labor productivity growth can be based on the within-sector and shift components. This decomposition reveals three important trends in the drivers of labor productivity in Germany and some countries in ECA (figure 1.12). \n\n- The deceleration in labor productivity growth in Germany started during the     1980s and continued in subsequent decades. Most of it was caused by weaker     productivity growth within sectors. This pattern is also evident in other major     European countries. \n\n- The contribution of sectoral shifts to overall labor productivity growth in Ger-     many changed markedly over time. Between the 1970s and the start of the     2000s, the shift of employment toward more productive sectors increased la-     bor productivity growth by about half a percentage point. The contribution of     sectoral shifts to labor productivity growth fell to zero after 2000 and turned     negative around the tim",
    "e of the 2008 global financial crisis. The long-term     trend of labor shifting toward sectors with higher labor productivity, and     likely higher capital intensity, came to an end when the digital economy start-     ed in earnest (see below). The contribution to labor productivity growth of the     shift of labor to more productive sectors was greater in Central European     countries than in Germany before the crisis, but as in Germany, it diminished \n\nFIGURE 1.12 **Labor** \n\n**productivity growth in** \n\n**Germany is on a long-term downward trend** \n\n \u001f4 \n\n \u001f3 \n\n \u001f2 \n\n \u001f1 \n\n 0 \n\n 1 \n\n 2 \n\n 3 \n\n 4 \n\n 5 \n\n 6 \n\n(^197119751979198319871991199519992003200720112015) **Labor productivity growth (percent)** Within-sector component Shift component _Source:_ Data from KLEMS dataset (available at [http://www.euklems.net/).](http://www.euklems.net/).)

During the boom period, FDI inflows created high-productivity jobs. These flows plummeted after the crisis. The contribution of the sectoral shift to productivity declined also in Armenia after the crisis (box 1.2). \n\n- Major crises—the second oil crisis of the late 1970s and the global financial \n\n crisis—led to a permanent loss in productivity. Even where productivity growth returned to the original (downward) trend, the damage of the crisis was not recouped. Productivity remains below the levels that would have been achieved had the crisis not occurred. The lasting impact of deep crises on productivity growth may have been caused by the loss of capital and skills that become obsolete or by a loss in confidence by workers who suffered extended bouts of unemployment. \n\nThe reasons for the long-term decline i",
    "n within-sector labor productivity \n\ngrowth, in many ECA countries and globally, have been debated in the economic \n\nliterature. The change in within-sector labor productivity can be decomposed \n\ninto changes generated by capital deepening and changes that cannot be ex\n\nplained (TFP). The contribution of capital deepening shrank significantly in sev\n\neral, but not all, countries during the years around the 2008 crisis. And almost all \n\ncountries experienced a decline in within-sector TFP growth. \n\nThe literature has suggested several possible causes for the slowdown in TFP. \n\nFirst, deep reforms led to a temporary rise in productivity growth in several ECA \n\nA new normal in Armenia \n\n Armenia’s economy changed markedly following the global crisis. Per capita GDP growth fell from 8.4 percent a year in 2003–09 to 3.2 percent a year in 2010–16. Labor productivity growth was similar in the two periods (6.7 percent a year before the crisis and 6.2 percent after), but migration flows, employ",
    "ment levels, and the composition of labor productivity growth changed dramatically. During the boom, many people found jobs abroad, especially toward the end of the period, when oil revenues skyrocketed in Russia. As a result, Armenia’s population declined by almost 5 percent between 2003 and 2009. At the same time, many jobs were created in construction and other nontradable sectors, to satisfy domestic demand fueled by remittances. The combination of emigration and job creation boosted the share of the population that was employed from 36 percent in 2003 to 40 percent in 2009. During those six years, the shift toward capital-intensive construction \n\n led to an increase in labor productivity of 4 percentage points a year. Within-sector productivity growth contributed only 2.7 percentage points to overall labor productivity growth, perhaps because elevated domestic demand reduced competitive pressures on the supply side. These patterns reversed in the aftermath of the crisis. Emigratio",
    "n slowed, the population increased by 1.7 percent between 2010 and 2016, and the construction sector and other nontradable sectors laid off workers. As a result, the share of the population that was employed fell to 34 percent. The impact of sectoral shifts on productivity growth turned negative, and the within-sector contribution to annual labor productivity growth increased to 7.4 percentage points. The increase may have reflected increased competition, as domestic demand declined and production shifted toward goods and services that are tradable in international markets. \n\nBOX 1.2 \n\n\n18 ● World Bank ECA Economic Update May 2018 \n\n countries. Productivity growth subsequently fell when major aspects of the reform agenda were completed. In Central Europe, reforms connected to EU accession initially boosted the growth of GDP and productivity. Reform momentum, and productivity growth, slowed after EU accession, in the mid-2000s (World Bank 2018). In Central Asia and the South Caucasus, T",
    "FP growth accelerated in the 1990s with institutional reforms in the early transition period. It plunged by the beginning of 2000s, perhaps because such benefits diminished as the room for further reforms narrowed. Second, across the world, technological changes in advanced and emerging economies affected the measurement and growth of productivity. The digital revolution that began in the 1990s led to a massive shift of resources to information and communications technology (ICT) industries. The output of these industries is notoriously difficult to measure (for example, how does one value free Internet services financed by advertisements?). If the value of these new services is understated, then aggregate measurements of productivity may also be understated, particularly if growth slows in more traditional industries that are losing labor and capital to the ICT sector. Given the magnitude of the slowdown, however, not all of it can be attributed to measurement issues (Syverson 2016). ",
    "The shift to ICT industries may also be connected to lower productivity. It is costly and time consuming to overcome the special difficulties involved in commercializing novel technologies (David 1990). Because it may take time to realize the return on the labor and capital moving to these new industries, shifts of labor and capital to (initially) low-return industries may depress aggregate productivity growth. In the United States, for example, the slowdown before the 2008 crisis occurred mainly in industries that produce information technology (IT) services or use such services intensively (Fernald 2015; Gordon 2016). Third, declining flexibility in some advanced countries may be reducing productivity growth. Business dynamism has declined in the United States, as reflected in the drop in reallocation rates for jobs (after 1990) and workers (after 2000) (Davis and Haltiwanger 2014), and the pace of startup creation in the United States declined over the 2000s (Haltiwanger 2011). Acro",
    "ss OECD countries, productivity growth in the most advanced firms remained robust over the 2000s, but the difference in productivity levels between leading and lagging firms widened (Andrews, Criscuolo, and Gal 2015; Haltiwanger 2011). This phenomenon may have deepened the productivity slowdown if barriers to the reallocation of labor and capital intensified. Fourth, long-term trends in the global economy may be contributing to the slowdown in productivity growth. Aging and other demographic factors may account for part of the decline (Maestas, Mullen, and Powell 2016). The slowdown in global trade integration following the crisis may also be contributing to slower TFP growth (Adler and others 2017). No single factor is responsible for the observed deceleration of productivity growth: long-term trends, sectoral shifts, reform momentums, and global crises all play roles. No silver bullet can reignite productivity growth. Policy makers need a diverse set of instruments to encourage innov",
    "ation, build up skills and infrastructure, and facilitate competition. \n\n\nChapter 1: Economic Developments and Prospects ● 19 \n\nNotes \n\n1. That used to be the rule globally, but after the global financial crisis a decade ago, that \n\n ratio came down closer to one.

Current real copper prices are also 57 percent below their historical peak, which was \n\n reached in April 1974. \n\n3. A key reform in Uzbekistan was the elimination of the dual exchange rate, which re- \n\n duced domestic price distortions and opened up new export opportunities. The government also reduced import duties and is harmonizing the duty code with Eurasian Economic Union norms. \n\n4. The much higher rate for youth unemployment is normal, for a variety of reasons. \n\n Search unemployment is much higher for people entering the labor market than for workers who already ha",
    "ve jobs. Cyclical changes in unemployment also tend to be more pronounced for young people. During crisis periods, the lack of job vacancies disproportionately hurts people entering the labor market for the first time. During economic recoveries the opposite happens, as the opening up of new vacancies disproportionately benefits newcomers to the labor market. \n\n5.

For a variety of reasons, this wave gained traction after the global financial crisis a decade ago. Large digital platforms, such as Alibaba, Amazon, Uber, and Airbnb, are replacing many brick-and-mortar stores, service companies, and long-term employment relationships. \n\n- Blockchain technologies aim to go one step farther. They organize P2P trans- \n\n actions and P2P information flows without companies that operate digital platforms. Whether these technologies will completely eliminate middlemen or whether new forms of trusted intermediaries will emerge remains to be seen. \n\n",
    "- Cryptocurrencies are the first—and therefore most developed—application of \n\n blockchain technologies. They create money without central banks and facilitate payments without financial institutions. The success of several cryptocurrencies puts competitive pressure on transaction methods by existing financial institutions. However, serious limitations have become apparent. Decentralized organization of markets without trusted intermediaries can be very costly, and the volatility of the value of cryptocurrencies is a big obstacle to their becoming an alternative to legal tender. \n\n### Cryptocurrencies and \n\n### Blockchain: Hype or \n\n### Transformational \n\n### Technologies? \n\n\n22 ● World Bank ECA Economic Update May 2018 \n\n- Other potential applications of blockchain technologies, from smart contracts     to decentralized databases and open source social networks, could well be-     come more transformational than cryptocurrencies. Current experiments are     likely to result in lasting",
    " innovations, even if current applications do not stand     the test of time. \n\n- The emergence of blockchain technologies has triggered a flurry of activities     in Europe and Central Asia (ECA), where people use cryptocurrencies for     cross-border transactions and as speculative investments. Start-up companies     are mining cryptocurrencies and providing blockchain services. Governments     are experimenting with blockchain technologies to make their services more     secure and more transparent. \n\n- Many factors provide a fertile ground for these activities in ECA. Several gov-     ernments actively support innovation by start-ups. Governments are eager to     digitize and streamline their services. Lack of trust in existing financial inter-     mediation makes cryptocurrencies an interesting alternative in some coun-     tries. Cryptocurrencies are also used to sidestep oversight of cross-border     transfers. Cheap electricity (in Iceland and Georgia, for example) entices the ",
    "    mining of cryptocurrencies. \n\n- Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies pose a range of policy chal-     lenges. They include the need to (a) apply rules of financial oversight, con-     sumer protection, and tax administration while at the same time encouraging     and facilitating innovation; (b) deal with the massive volume of electricity     used to mine cryptocurrencies; and (c) determine whether governments and     central banks can use blockchain technologies to improve their services. Poli-     cymakers should find a balance between curbing the hype and unleashing     potentially transformational new opportunities. International coordination is     needed to share best practices, avoid regulatory arbitrage, and explore how to     regulate global decentralized networks. \n\nIntroduction \n\n Ten years after an ingenious experiment to create a cryptocurrency that allows secure and anonymous digital transactions to take place without the involvement of central banks or commer",
    "cial banks, cryptocurrencies have become a multibillion-dollar industry. By December 2017, the average price of one bitcoin (the first cryptocurrency) had risen from just a few cents in 2009 to $15,000, doubling its value in a single month. These gains attracted many investors across the world. On December 1, 2017, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved trading in bitcoin futures. Although the price of a bitcoin had declined to about $8,000 in April 2018, the value of bitcoins in circulation was about $150 billion as of April 10, 2018. Big companies, and individuals working together in large pools, are competing for the right to add new transactions to the existing chain of transactions. Their revenues, in the form of new bitcoins and transaction fees, are close to $20 million a day. \n\n\nChapter 2: Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain: Hype or Transformational Technologies? ● 23 \n\nIn the wake of bitcoin’s success, hundreds of alternative cryptocurrencies \n\nhave been created. ",
    "Digital tokens have been issued as general currency; for spe\n\ncific purposes (for example, to rent computer capacity or cloud storage); and as \n\nan alternative to traditional shares in companies. \n\nCryptocurrencies have evoked strong reactions. Critics call these virtual cur\n\nrencies a bubble, a scam, and even evil (Krugman 2013; Popper 2018). Supporters \n\npredict that cryptocurrencies will ultimately replace money (Rooney 2018). \n\nThere is less disagreement about the underlying blockchain technology, a pro\n\ntocol to achieve decentralized consensus about the validity of a common data\n\nbase, stored in multiple locations. Many recognize that the blockchain protocol \n\ncan lead to tamper-proof, secure information systems without the need for a \n\nsingle administrator. But even here views differ markedly about how transforma\n\ntional this technology is. Believers foresee utopian societies of self-regulating in\n\ndividuals, without government or trusted intermediaries. Doubters argue that \n\nthe",
    " number of useful applications has been exaggerated, that lack of regulation \n\ncan have disastrous effects, and that in most cases trusted intermediaries will \n\ncontinue to provide useful services. \n\nIt is unclear how these technologies will develop in the long run. Conceivably, \n\nthey could be absorbed by existing institutions, with central banks issuing digital \n\ncash, governments using blockchain to maintain information systems, and com\n\nmercial banks putting payment systems on the blockchain. 1 Many intermediaries \n\nmight become obsolete, and many new financial instruments might be created by \n\ncompanies that do not yet exist. The main legacy of cryptocurrencies may not be \n\nthe blockchain technology but standardized digital IDs using a combination of \n\npublic and private keys on open-source software. 2 Such a development would \n\nallow individuals to own more of their data, instead of participating in proprie\n\ntary information networks (Johnson 2018). \n\nWhatever the future brings, ",
    "cryptocurrencies and blockchain protocols are \n\npart of a tidal wave of new technologies that is changing the way production and \n\ncommerce are organized. Digital platforms, the sharing economy, apps, and 3D \n\nprinters are fragmenting production and facilitating P2P transactions. \n\nMany of these new applications originated soon after the global financial cri\n\nsis of 2008, when the bankruptcies of established companies convinced many \n\npeople that the economy would never be the same again. Investors were looking \n\nfor new investment opportunities. Workers who had lost their jobs were willing \n\nto accept more flexible working relations. Consumers were persuaded to use \n\nsome of their underutilized assets commercially. \n\nThe fact that bitcoin was created in 2009, soon after the crisis, was probably no \n\ncoincidence. Trust in financial institutions had eroded, and the time was ripe to \n\nexplore fundamentally different approaches. Whatever the future of cryptocur\n\nrencies and blockchain tec",
    "hnologies may be, the trends toward decentralization \n\nand P2P transactions are unmistakable. \n\nCryptocurrency and blockchain activities are widespread in Europe and Cen\n\ntral Asia (ECA). Massive mining of cryptocurrencies takes place in Iceland, Swe\n\nden, and Georgia. Many Russians own digital wallets, and experiments are ongo\n\ning in Serbia and Tajikistan to use blockchain technology to make the sending of \n\n\n24 ● World Bank ECA Economic Update May 2018 \n\n remittances more efficient (UNDP 2018). Estonia is using blockchain software in registries and plans to extend its use to medicine (https://e-estonia.com/). Startups in many countries in ECA are contributing to these technologies, attracting finance for their activities via initial coin offerings (ICOs). 3 Household investments in cryptocurrencies are not insignificant. Switzerland aims to become a cryptocurrency and blockchain hub and is leading in adjusting regulations to these new technologies. Comprehensive, global information ",
    "on cryptocurrency and blockchain activities is not available. But anecdotal evidence suggests that ECA is more active than many other parts of the world, likely because of a combination of factors. Governments of many countries—from Estonia to Georgia and Slovenia—are experimenting with blockchain technologies. In many countries in the region, a supportive business climate encourages start-ups. And, especially in the eastern part of the region, the relatively new financial sector provides fertile ground for experiments. The lack of legacy technologies in the financial sector—and the lack of trusted intermediaries—makes exploring new financial instruments attractive. The rest of this chapter is organized as follows. Section 2.2 looks at the successes and drawbacks of cryptocurrencies, examining whether there is a future for money not issued by central banks. Section 2.3 looks at the possibility of smart contracts. It assesses whether markets can be organized without intermediaries and e",
    "xplores the possibility of secure decentralized databases. Section 2.4 summarizes some of the activities in ECA, with an emphasis on the experience in Georgia, which has been particularly active. Section 2.5 addresses the many policy challenges these new technologies have triggered. \n\nCreating digital money without central banks \n\n Since the emergence of e-commerce, myriad attempts have been made to develop electronic payment systems. 4 Many successful and unsuccessful attempts were linked to credit card systems. Attempts to create digital cash are especially thought-provoking. Like coins and banknotes, digital cash should be anonymous and counterfeit-proof. People should be able to use it without the intermediation of banks, in the same way traditional cash is used outside the banking system. But unlike traditional cash, individuals, rather than a central bank, would create these digital coins. Private parties rather than the government would thus accrue the seigniorage. The white pap",
    "er that started bitcoin in 2008 outlined a way to create and operate a decentralized electronic cash system (Nakamoto 2008). The payment system would not be under the control of a bank or a central authority. Rather, a large number of independent participants would operate it. The paper used existing cryptographic techniques of public and private keys to create anonymous and secure IDs. It used existing cryptographic time stamps, based on hash functions, to make past transactions irreversible. With those elements, electronic cash could become (pseudo)anonymous and counterfeit-proof. 5 But the main contribution of the white paper was the method it proposed to keep track of past transactions without a trusted intermediary. It would be done through an automatic process \n\n\nChapter 2: Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain: Hype or Transformational Technologies? ● 25 \n\nthat would achieve consensus among most participants about the cumulative \n\nhistory of transactions, even if a minority of partici",
    "pants sent erroneous messages \n\nto the network. \n\nThe solution to this so-called _distributed consensus problem_ was to let partici\n\npants compete for permission to add a new batch of transactions to the decentral\n\nized database. Participants use their computer power to solve a difficult puzzle. \n\nThe solution, which is considered proof of work, is impossible to find analyti\n\ncally; it can be reached only through trial and error. The first person who solves \n\nthe puzzle can add a block of new transactions to the chain of existing transac\n\ntions—hence the term _blockchain_ —and broadcast the new block to the network, \n\nso that all participants can update the blockchain in their own copy.^6 \n\nAlthough the puzzle is difficult to solve, its solution is easy to verify. There\n\nfore, the nodes in the bitcoin network can easily determine if a proposed block is \n\nvalid and should be added to the chain. Even if a node goes offline for a period \n\nof time, the network is not jeopardized. When the ",
    "node goes back online, it ac\n\ncepts the longest valid chain as the correct one. If most of the computer power is \n\nowned by honest participants, the expectation is that they will create the longest \n\nchain, as the probability that they add new blocks is proportional to their com\n\nputer power. As a result, the longest chain can be considered the consensus view. \n\nIf a dishonest participant adds a block that is not accepted by others in the chain, \n\nthat block will not become part of the longest chain, because the participant will \n\nnot have enough computer power to add more blocks to the chain quickly \n\nenough. The difficulty of the puzzle is adjusted every two weeks, in order to cre\n\nate about one block per 10 minutes. Limiting the addition of a new block to the \n\nblockchain to one every 10 minutes (on average) prevents the network from be\n\ning overwhelmed and keeps the size of the blockchain manageable. \n\nCompetition for the right to add a block to the blockchain also solved the \n\npro",
    "blem of the creation of new electronic coins. People who solve the puzzle re\n\nceive a combination of newly minted coins and transaction fees. 7 With every \n\nblock, new coins are created. Every four years the number of new coins per block \n\nis cut in half, until the maximum number of 21 million bitcoins is reached. Most \n\nof the remaining bitcoins will be added over the next 15 years. The creation of \n\nnew digital coins is like unearthing gold, which is why the puzzle solvers are \n\ncalled _miners_ in the world of cryptocurrencies. \n\nTen years after the publication of the white paper, the concepts underlying \n\nbitcoin have proven successful. The blockchain technology is working and se\n\ncure. Seventeen million bitcoins have been created, with an aggregate value of \n\n$137 billion in 2018. Numerous alternative cryptocurrencies have emerged, and \n\nmany companies and research groups are exploring additional blockchain ap\n\nplications. Cryptocurrencies have unleashed a wave of financial innovat",
    "ions, \n\nputting competitive pressure on the financial sector, especially its facilitation of \n\ncross-border transfers. \n\nBitcoin’s biggest success has also become its most worrisome weakness. The \n\nproof-of-work concept that ensured achievement of a decentralized consensus \n\nhas become excessively costly and wasteful. Attracted by the reward of newly \n\nminted digital coins, investors have created massive computer power with spe\n\ncialized chips to compete for permission to add a block to the blockchain. Over \n\n\n26 ● World Bank ECA Economic Update May 2018 \n\n the past few months, the reward for solving the puzzle ranged from $100,000 to $250,000, depending on the price of bitcoin, the fees per transaction, and the number of transactions in a block. As more computer power was added to the network, the puzzle automatically became more difficult (figure 2.1). As a result, more and more electricity was needed to solve the puzzle. The system currently consumes an estimated 53 TWh of electrici",
    "ty a year— almost as much as the entire country of Bangladesh consumes (Digiconomist n.d.). The cost of electricity used to process a single average transaction (about $20) can power about five households in a high-income country for a day. These electricity costs are likely to rise. Because miners’ profits of are still large, more computer power is being added to the network, increasing the difficulty of the puzzle. People who use the network to transfer bitcoins do not directly experience these costs, because miners are paid mainly through seigniorage rather than fees. But the costs in terms of electricity use, and the resulting burden on the environment, are real. A paradoxical side-effect of the rapid increase in computing power is that computer power has become more concentrated. A few companies have installed huge computer capacity in large dedicated factories, using specialized chips. Their exploitation of economies of scale leads to concentration of market power. Participants w",
    "ith less computer power started working together in pools (figure 2.2). With limited computing power, the probability of being the first to solve the puzzle is very small, and the income stream is irregular and thus unpredictable. By pooling forces, participants can generate a small but steady income stream. This concentration of computer power makes the network more vulnerable to malicious attacks. Even without attacks, if the market becomes an oligopoly, miners could manipulate transaction fees, refuse to process certain types of transactions, or deny service to users. \n\nFIGURE 2.1 **As the price** \n\n**of bitcoin soared in 2017,** \n\n**so did competition** \n\n**among miners** \n\n 1-Mar-18 \n\n 0 \n\n 5E+11 \n\n 1E+12 \n\n 1.5E+12 \n\n 2E+12 \n\n 2.5E+12 \n\n 3E+12 \n\n 3.5E+12 \n\n 1-Mar-161-May-161-Jul-161-Sep-161-Nov-161-Jan-171-Mar-171-May-171-Jul-171-Sep-171-Nov-171-Jan-18 \n\n Mining Difficulty Index \n\n Source : blockchain.info. Note: The bitcoin difficulty index measures the difficulty of finding a n",
    "ew block on the blockchain. The greater the difficulty, the longer the time it takes on average for a miner to find a valid block. The difficulty in the first block of the bitcoin blockchain was 1. The difficulty is adjusted up or down every 2,016 blocks. If the previous 2,016 blocks take less than two weeks to generate, the difficulty is increased (and vice versa). \n\n\nChapter 2: Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain: Hype or Transformational Technologies? ● 27 \n\nFIGURE 2.2 **Three large** \n\n**mining pools provide** \n\n**half of all network blocks** \n\n BTC.com 24% \n\n AntPool 13% \n\n ViaBTC SlushPool11% 12% \n\n BTC.TOP 10% \n\n Unknown 9% \n\n F2Pool 7% \n\n BTCC Pool 4% \n\n BitFury 3% \n\n BitClub Network 3% \n\n GBMiners 1% BW.COM 1% \n\n Bitcoin.com 0% \n\n KanoPool \n\n1% (^) 58COIN 1% _Source_ : blockchain.info. _Note_ : Data are for March 2018. The danger of market concentration is likely to increase. As the number of newly minted bitcoins declines, the income of miners will increasingly depend on fees. Lo",
    "wer profits will discourage new investors from entering the market, and smaller, inefficient miners are likely to exit. The sustainability of a completely decentralized payment system will be tested if miners must forgo the large profits coming from seigniorage. An advantage of declining profits because of disappearing seigniorage is that electricity use will no longer increase and might even decline. Box 2.1 models the long-term mechanisms determining the degree of difficulty of the puzzle, energy use, user fees, and even the price of bitcoins. The model is simplistic, particularly as it ignores adjustment lags and speculative bubbles, which likely play a significant role in reality. But it sheds light on balancing mechanisms in the cryptocurrency market and provides a framework for exploring the consequences of the disappearance of seigniorage. As of spring 2018, the total reward a miner received per transaction was just below $100 (figure 2.3). Most of it comes through seignorage (t",
    "he bitcoin block reward) rather than fees. The impact on the demand for bitcoin if this reward shifts away from seignorage toward fees may not be dramatic. Large international bank transfers can involve similar levels of fees (through the SWIFT international payment system). \n\n\n28 ● World Bank ECA Economic Update May 2018 \n\nEquilibrium mechanisms in the bitcoin market \n\n Over time, as fewer and fewer bitcoins are created, the income of miners will shift from seigniorage toward fees. This box models the consequences of the shift for electricity use and other characteristics of the mining process. Assume that miners use the following production function to solve the puzzle that allows them to add transactions to the blockchain: \n\n(2.1.1) \n\n where T S^ is the total number of transactions miners supply, A is the level of technology, K is the capital stock, E is the electricity consumption, and D is the difficulty of the puzzle. There is substitution between capital and electricity: miners ",
    "can install more advanced, more electricity-efficient equip ment to achieve the same solution power with less electricity. Miners minimize costs under the restriction of the production function, where the cost per transaction is \n\n(2.1.2) \n\n where c is the cost per transaction, r is the return to capital, δ is the depreciation rate of the equipment, \n\n_P_ (^) _h_ is the price of the capital goods, and _Pe_ is the price of electricity. This optimization leads to the following cost per transaction _c_ : (2.1.3) If there are profits, new miners will keep entering the market, which will cause the difficulty of the puzzle to adjust so that in equilibrium profits equal zero: (2.1.4) where _n_ is the block reward in terms of the number of newly minted bitcoins, _p_ is the price of bitcoin, and _f_ are the fees. The market is not yet in equilibrium. Miners’ profits are still large, as is the risk-adjusted return. As a result, still more investments in computing power should be expected, which ",
    "will increase the difficulty of the puzzle. In equilibrium, the difficulty of the puzzle is given by (2.1.5) Demand for transactions by consumers is downward sloping in the size of the transaction fees: (2.1.6) where _T D_^ is the total desired number of transactions miners supply, and _B_ is a scaling factor. The fees will be determined by the condition (2.1.7) If consumers want more transactions than miners can facilitate, fees will go up and demand for transactions will adjust. Miners are constrained by the rule that only one block with not many more than 2,000 transactions can be added to the blockchain. This restriction is represented by _T_. Consequently, fees are determined by consumer preferences and the maximum number of transactions allowed in the system: (2.1.8) The final price to endogenize is the price of a bitcoin. Currently, speculative behavior, which is very difficult to model, is likely to be one of the determinants of that price. A standard money demand function can ",
    "describe the main determinants: (2.1.9) where _p_ is the price of bitcoin, _a_ is the average size of transactions, and _V_ is the velocity of money. If people want to keep bitcoins in their wallet because they expect the price to rise, then the velocity of circulation will fall and the current price will rise. If people want to transfer larger values with bitcoins, pushing up the average value of transactions, the price will also rise. These factors may have been the two main drivers behind the sharp increase in the bitcoin price in December BOX 2.1 _(Continued next page)_ \n\n\nChapter 2: Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain: Hype or Transformational Technologies? ● 29 \n\n(continued) \n\n2017. Market participants bought bitcoins to trans- fer large sums, and speculation pushed the price farther up. In equilibrium the bitcoin price would be given by \n\n(2.1.10) \n\n where M S^ is the exogenously given number of bitcoins in circulation. Substituting this result in the difficulty expression yields \n\n",
    "(2.1.11) \n\n The reduced-form equation for energy use per transaction is \n\n(2.1.12) \n\n This model suggests that the system could achieve a long-term equilibrium in which electricity consumption is lower because fewer bitcoins are \n\n created. A decline in n reduces the energy use per transaction. Increasing the price of energy can also reduce energy use. Such a price increase would not increase the cost of transactions, it would merely reduce the difficulty of the puzzle, as some miners are pushed out of the market. Increasing the overall energy efficiency of mining (increasing A in equation 2.1.1) does not reduce energy use. It merely makes the puzzle more difficult. The long-term equilibrium can be achieved at a lower electricity use, but this raises other concerns. It could lead to even more concentration of mining power, as in the process many miners would exit the market, making it easier for highly specialized mining facilities to capture larger shares of the computational power. T",
    "he concentration of mining power could erode trust in the network and thus reduce incentives to hold bitcoins long, increasing the velocity of money, which would cause a drop in the price and further instability in the network. \n\nBOX 2.1 \n\n 0 \n\n 20 \n\n 40 \n\n 60 \n\n 80 \n\n 100 \n\n 120 \n\n 140 \n\n 160 \n\n 180 \n\n 23-Mar-1618-May-1613-Jul-167-Sep-162-Nov-1628-Dec-1622-Feb-1719-Apr-1714-Jun-179-Aug-174-Oct-1729-Nov-1724-Jan-1821-Mar-18 \n\n Earnings of miners (dollars) \n\n Mining revenue per transaction Fees per transaction \n\n FIGURE 2.3 Most mining revenue comes from the seignorage (block reward) of the network \n\n Source : blockchain.info. \n\n\n30 ● World Bank ECA Economic Update May 2018 \n\n The lack of scalability of the bitcoin payment system is another limitation. The proof-of-work concept prevents malicious participants from overwhelming the blockchain, ensuring its veracity. But it limits the addition of new blocks to one every 10 minutes and each block to a maximum size of 1 MB. The average numb",
    "er of transactions that can be included in a block of this size is 2,000. In its current form, the bitcoin payment network can thus process only three transactions per second. By contrast, credit card companies process thousands of transactions per second. This constraint makes it impossible for bitcoin to substitute for largescale digital payment systems. Many attempts have been made, through new cryptocurrencies or additions to the bitcoin network, to avoid the electricity-consuming puzzle and to increase scalability. A leading concept is proof of stake, which could replace proof of work.^8 In this concept, participants are elected to add a new block to the blockchain on the basis of the amount of own coins they want to attach to the contract. This proof-of-stake concept is like putting coins in escrow to earn permission to intermediate and charge transaction fees. Selection would still be probabilistic, but richer participants would have a higher probability of being selected. Ether",
    "eum, which runs a popular cryptocurrency, may adopt this approach. It represents a shift back in the direction of trusted intermediaries. The concept is not very different from existing financial institutions that are trusted because they have a stake in preserving their company. An even more radical departure from proof of work is to grant the authority to maintain the blockchain to a limited number of preselected, trusted participants. Ripple has taken this approach, working with commercial banks. It reinstates trusted intermediaries into the blockchain network. Another experiment to reduce electricity costs is to design a simple, albeit less secure, system for small transactions and to put only the balances of many small transactions on the blockchain. Lightning Network is taking this approach, as an addition to the bitcoin blockchain (Poon and Dryja 2016). Most of the discussions in the cryptocurrency community are about mechanisms to make trusted intermediaries superfluous. But an",
    "other important question is how well cryptocurrencies perform the traditional functions of money. Money is useful because it can serve as medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value. Like other forms of electronic money, cryptocurrencies have advantages over physical commodities like gold or banknotes. They are easier to store and easier to transfer over large distances. However, some inherent drawbacks of cryptocurrencies make them less optimal than legal tender in most countries. The most important drawback is the volatility of the purchasing power of cryptocurrencies, as illustrated by their exchange rate vis-à-vis legal tender (figure 2.4). That volatility in purchasing power makes them very risky to accept as a medium of exchange. It also makes them suboptimal as a store of value, as there is no guarantee that their value will not drop to zero. Advocates argue that cryptocurrencies cannot be inflationary, because their supply is fixed or at least limited. In fact, ",
    "cryptocurrencies can be extremely inflationary if demand for them \n\n\nChapter 2: Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain: Hype or Transformational Technologies? ● 31 \n\n drops (because, for example, customers prefer alternative cryptocurrencies that are more user-friendly, are more scalable, or provide more privacy). The volatility of their purchasing power also reduces the value of cryptocurrencies as a unit of measurement. With large overall price swings, it becomes difficult to discern movements in relative prices.^9 In fact, there may be a natural limit to how stable the price of bitcoin can become. Unlike other commodity-type assets, bitcoin does not have a feedback loop from the supply side. \n\n Source : coinmarketcap.com.

Extracting information about relative prices would be very costly. Entering into long-term contracts could become prohibitively expensive. The blockchain has proven to be very secure, but it is impossible to avoid security concerns altogether. Cryptocurrencies h",
    "ave been stolen by hacks into exchanges, where they are exchanged against legal tender or other cryptocurrencies, and hacks into mining pools. Users can protect stored cryptocurrencies by keeping their wallets offline. These offline wallets are called cold wallets ; wallets that are online are called hot wallets. Exchanges cannot be avoided; they remain a weak link. The problem is especially severe because once stolen there is little recourse to recover the funds. Many of these problems are already being addressed. The security breaches of exchange sites forced many exchanges to use hot and cold wallets. This practice involves storing most deposits in an offline wallet, whose private keys are secure and are never stored on a network-connected device. A small portion of the deposits is transferred to the hot wallet, which is used for daily transactions and payments. If there is a security breach, potential losses are limited to the amount stored in the hot wallet; at least in theory, mo",
    "st deposits should be protected. The attractiveness of cryptocurrencies will be tested once governments extend their financial oversight to cryptocurrencies in their efforts to fight money laundering, tax evasion, and illicit transactions. Doing so will challenge the (pseudo) anonymity of the cryptocurrencies. This oversight will be easier if the concentration of mining power continues to increase. To the extent that current use is motivated partly by the desire to avoid oversight, increased surveillance will reduce demand for cryptocurrencies. However, it is also possible that oversight may make the use of cryptocurrencies more attractive, as it becomes easier to incorporate them in the overall financial infrastructure. The innovative power of cryptocurrencies has been impressive. They have already put some competitive pressure on cross-border payment systems. The concept is promising, because it potentially improves financial access for people who live in remote areas that are not co",
    "vered by financial institutions. It would be wrong to judge cryptocurrencies on the current state of affairs. As with many new technologies, childhood diseases will be outgrown. However, their real contribution may turn out to be very different from originally foreseen. The original designer of bitcoin and the blockchain technology wrote that “the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required” (Nakamoto 2008). In fact, the future benefits may appear precisely because the networks shift back to trusted intermediaries. It is even conceivable that the most successful cryptocurrencies will be linked to legal tender and issued by central banks. \n\nCreating digital markets without intermediaries \n\n The ability to achieve distributed consensus, and to store immutable information in a decentralized database, makes a wide variety of P2P contracts possible without a centralized authority. Enthusiasm about other possibilities is enormous. As one observer put it, “The paradox ab",
    "out bitcoin is that it may well turn out to be \n\n\nChapter 2: Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain: Hype or Transformational Technologies? ● 33 \n\na revolutionary breakthrough and at the same time a colossal failure as a cur\n\nrency” (Johnson 2018). \n\nSmart, or self-executing, contracts are examples of blockchain applications \n\nthat go well beyond instantaneous transfers of funds with cryptocurrencies. Such \n\ncontracts could be used on a blockchain platform to engage in commitments over \n\ntime, without the help of middlemen. Ethereum, which has been operational \n\nsince the summer of 2015, enables the creation of P2P contracts that outline the \n\nconditions under which future payments occur. \n\nOne example of such a smart contract is a parametric insurance contract, such \n\nas a contract that insures farmers against drought. The seller commits to pay a \n\ncertain amount if rainfall remains below a certain threshold. The contract is pre\n\nprogrammed to read the realized rainfall from a trusted weathe",
    "r data feed at a \n\npoint in the future. The buyer purchases the contract with a one-time payment. \n\nThe seller commits funds equal to the maximum payout in case of a drought. As \n\nthe contract is fully collateralized, there is no counterparty risk. At the expiration \n\ndate, either the buyer or the seller can execute the contract to check if the trigger \n\ncondition has been met. The contract distributes the funds between the buyer and \n\nthe seller and terminates itself. This type of contract could be handled without \n\nintermediation (although insurance companies could also provide such con\n\ntracts). Storing these contracts on the blockchain makes them immutable and \n\nguarantees their enforcement. \n\nSmart contracts could also be used for financial instruments other than insur\n\nance. Entrepreneurs already sell tokens to fund new companies through ICOs \n\nand promise future dividend payments in a smart contract on a blockchain. The \n\ntokens are similar to shares issued in an initial public ",
    "offering (IPO), but there are \n\nkey differences. Shares are sold on stock markets and typically give the right via \n\nshareholder representation to participate in decision making. In contrast, tokens \n\nare traded on a P2P blockchain with no privileges outside what is written in the \n\nsmart contract. Regulators across the world are working on directives that would \n\nextend oversight to ICOs. Doing so would increase the similarities between ICOs \n\nand IPOs, but the financial smart contract would provide a new, innovative, in\n\nstrument to fund start-ups. It creates relatively liquid new financial instruments \n\nthat can be used to finance small-scale risky ventures. \n\nThe potential advantages of such P2P contracts are obvious. They could be \n\navailable to people who have no access to financial instruments (box 2.2). They \n\ncould also increase access to financial services that is now limited because of \n\ndistrust in financial institutions. Currently, enforcement of contracts is not \n\nstraigh",
    "tforward in parts of ECA. Smart contracts are secure, even if the counter\n\nparties do not know each other. Blockchain platforms could make these financial \n\nproducts more liquid if the new products could be traded outside specialized \n\nmarkets. \n\nThere are potential disadvantages of smart contracts. Adjustments to the cur\n\nrent blockchain platforms are likely required for them to work in a user-friendly, \n\nefficient, and scalable way. These drawbacks may be the reason why, outside \n\nICOs, there have not yet been large-scale applications of smart contracts. \n\nThe first disadvantage of existing platforms is the volatility of the value of \n\ncryptocurrencies, which is especially inconvenient with contracts that span many \n\n\n34 ● World Bank ECA Economic Update May 2018 \n\nProviding access to secure insurance \n\n In many countries, individuals, farmers, and smallto medium-size businesses have limited or no access to insurance or hedging instruments for commodity price risks, floods, hurricanes",
    ", exchange rate volatility, and the like. Markets are incomplete or not available. When they are available, contracts are often not trusted to be enforced or are very costly, particularly for small transactions. Lack of this key financial service is associated with a high risk of falling into poverty, business failure, and the absence of entrepreneurship. \n\n Suppose that a small wheat farmer in a developing country is 30 days away from harvest. Although she may be happy with the current wheat price, she knows that she can sustain at most a 20 percent drop between now and the time she sells her harvest. In order to hedge against a larger decline, the farmer can purchase a put option with a duration of one month and a strike that is 20 percent lower than the current market price. Entering in such a contract will ensure that if the price falls below the strike price, the contract will pay the difference. The contract mitigates the risk by creating a price floor. Despite the relative simpl",
    "icity of these contracts, many frictions may prevent small farmers from entering into such agreements. Although bilateral over-the-counter agreements are possible, the legal framework may not be well adapted to accommodate them, and enforcement can be difficult and costly. Smalland medium-size farm\n\n Especially in the transition economies of ECA, financial markets are incomplete. Market-based financial institutions were established only in the early 1990s in these economies, and they are still only partially developed. Insurance products are particularly underdeveloped. The insurance rate of farmers in ECA is well below the global average (box figure 2.2.1). A recent report finds that these incomplete financial sectors are associated with lower growth of the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution (Gould and Melecky 2017). \n\n ers are not likely to have access to international financial markets in which these contracts are well established and markets are deep, and the need for int",
    "ermediaries can make the process prohibitively expensive. Government interventions to support such contracts have often been ineffective. Such policies are either too costly from the government fiscal standpoint or create moral hazard if noninsured risks are covered by government payouts in the event of widespread loss. Blockchain technology and smart contracts raise the potential for insurance/minimum price contracts that are flexible, low-cost, secure, and highly customizable to a multitude of risks and payouts (large and small), with only marginal transactions costs. This approach would provide easy access to foreign insurers, and enforcement costs would be low if the payout were collateralized in the blockchain. \n\nBOX 2.2 \n\n FIGURE B2.2.1 Farmers in Europe and Central Asia are underinsured \n\n 0 \n\n 1 \n\n 2 \n\n 3 \n\n 4 \n\n 5 \n\n 6 \n\n 7 \n\n Sub-Saharan Africa \n\n Developing East Asia and Pacific \n\n World South Asia Developing Europe and Central Asia \n\n Adults working in agriculturewho purcha",

Parties to the contract likely want security in terms of the purchasing \n\npower of payments. That goal could possibly be met by linking the contracts to \n\nfutures markets, but it seems more promising to use tokens that are linked to le\n\ngal tender. Doing so would be a major step away from the original concept of \n\ncryptocurrencies, as it requires a trusted party that can guarantee the value of the \n\ntoken. Still, it could be a natural development of the smart contracts. \n\nFizzy is a parametric insurance application by the insurance company AXA \n\n(https://fizzy.axa/), in which passengers purchase insurance by sending funds \n\nto the smart contract along with their flight information. If their flight is delayed \n\nfor more than two hours according to a publicly accessible database",
    ", the smart \n\ncontracts pays out compensation in euros. Fizzy could be developed into an \n\nEthereum-based smart contract, but the volatility of the Ether token is likely to \n\nprove too much of a drawback for a large-scale application. \n\nIf contracts shift to tokens that are linked to legal tender, the market can no \n\nlonger operate without a trusted intermediary. Such an intermediary must sell \n\nadditional tokens in exchange for legal tender if demand for tokens increases. \n\nThe intermediary must hold part of the legal tender in reserve, so that tokens can \n\nbe repurchased if demand declines. Such reserves are similar to the reserves fi\n\nnancial institutions must hold when they create electronic accounts or mobile \n\npayment systems. In the case of tokens linked to legal tender, participants who \n\nmaintain the blockchain would no longer be rewarded with the seigniorage of \n\nnew coins; the reward would consist only of fees paid by the parties in the con\n\ntract. These fees might not be en",
    "ough to attract enough participants who want to \n\ncompete with one another. It is plausible that such a system would naturally \n\nconverge to a permissioned blockchain, in which several preselected servers up\n\ndate the blockchain, eliminating the need for costly competition among servers \n\nand making the maintenance of the platform more efficient. \n\nA second disadvantage of smart contracts is that they are collateralized by \n\nfreezing potential payouts on the blockchain. The blockchain provides security, \n\nbut it is also inefficient (like putting money in escrow, where it cannot be used \n\nproductively). Insurance companies can pool risks and invest the cash flow. As a \n\nresult, they should be able to provide cheaper services than offered in P2P con\n\ntracts, in which investing the cash flow is not possible. Cutting out insurance \n\ncompanies could thus increase costs. \n\nThere may be a trade-off between efficiency and independence from interme\n\ndiaries. Higher costs may be worth paying whe",
    "re the public does not trust that \n\nnormal contracts will be enforced. Where trust exists, the public might prefer to \n\ndeal with insurance companies rather than anonymous peers. If blockchain con\n\ntracts are used, trusted intermediaries will likely offer contracts without freezing \n\nthe assets in the contract, reintroducing trust into these transactions. \n\nA similar argument holds for standard financial intermediation by banks. Be\n\ncause P2P contracts likely have a broader reach and can create innovative instru\n\nments, they could provide competitive additions to existing banking products. \n\nHowever, commercial banks have a big advantage in financial intermediation. By \n\npooling risk, they can turn short-term liabilities into long-term assets. Because \n\nintermediation between savings and investments is much more difficult in inde\n\npendent P2P contracts without risk pooling, smart contracts are likely to be com\n\n\n36 ● World Bank ECA Economic Update May 2018 \n\n bined with, or even integr",
    "ated into, existing financial institutions, rather than replacing them. Risk pooling could also be explicitly programmed in smart contracts, implying that these contracts will not be completely risk free. A third potential disadvantage of following the original blockchain design for smart contracts is the public nature of the blockchain. Transparency is attractive because it makes it easy to audit the validity of contracts by virtually anyone with an Internet connection. But participants in transactions may want more privacy. Therefore, it is plausible that smart contract applications will develop in the direction of more encryption, more restricted-read access, or both.^10 Many governments are experimenting with blockchain to digitize their services. Experiments with land and real estate registries are popular. One objective is to avoid the vulnerabilities of a centralized server. Decentralized storage of data means that several servers are always online, making it more difficult to a",
    "lter data. Another objective is to prepare for a link with smart contracts, so that real estate could be sold online without the help of notaries, as ownership could be verified on the blockchain. Governments would still take responsibility for the information, including information about zoning and restrictions on sales. The goal is thus not to purge governments from transactions but rather to make government services more efficient and more trustworthy. In these applications, the registry can be updated by a limited, selected number of servers (a permissioned approach). There is no need to let an undetermined number of miners compete for the updates. There is, however, a need for full transparency. Not everyone should be able to write on the system, but everyone should be able to read the registry. The reading provides the actual service and is also a mechanism for double-checking the veracity of the information. Another government application could be public procurement. The central",
    " government could issue a token backed by the national currency. Each ministry or municipality could be issued an address and allocated tokens as part of the budget process. They would use the tokens to pay contractors for public purchases; contractors would redeem their tokens with the central government. This mechanism would make all purchases not only fully transparent but also instantly auditable by anyone, reducing graft. Social protection transfers could benefit from a similar set-up, although privacy concerns would have to be addressed. Large companies are also exploring blockchain applications. Companies need to be online all the time, for internal communications and communications with clients. One central server is not reliable in this respect; a system that provides a common view of information through communication between independent servers is superior to a central server. Decentralized information is also more difficult to alter through hacks, because hackers would have ",
    "to break into more than one server. Companies are experimenting with different versions of the blockchain protocol to transition toward a more decentralized information strategy. Experiments are moving toward permissioned systems, with a preselected number of servers maintaining the decentralized database. Decentralizing reduces the probability that participating servers become malicious, makes it easier to secure them, and \n\n\nChapter 2: Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain: Hype or Transformational Technologies? ● 37 \n\nprevents the costly competition that is needed in a permission-less system. The \n\ndecentralized consensus problem is easier to solve than in the original bitcoin \n\napplication. However, with a small number of servers, data systems other than \n\nblockchain could be used. The advantages of a permissioned system may be the \n\nreason why there are no large-scale blockchain applications yet in these compa\n\nnies, despite the many experiments. \n\nBlockchain technology could also be us",
    "ed to manage vast and diverse data \n\nsystems, such as health records, that are too complicated for a central server. They \n\ncould benefit from decentralized servers that communicate with one another and \n\nalways reflect the latest update of treatments and test results. The existence of \n\nsecure, decentralized digital health records could significantly increase the effi\n\nciency of the health care industry. \n\nThe main challenge for these kinds of data systems is privacy. Both reading \n\nand writing of health records should be limited. This requires adjustments to the \n\noriginal blockchain design, which is public, in the sense that everyone can read \n\nit. A health record application would be private, with secure encryption to protect \n\nconfidentiality of medical information. \n\nThese examples show the broad range of potential applications of blockchain. \n\nThey also suggest that many of them could be very different from the original \n\nblockchain design. Instead of a public database, with an ",
    "unlimited number of \n\nparticipants that maintain the blockchain and an independent cryptocurrency to \n\nbe used in transactions, the most successful future applications could work with \n\nprivate information, a limited number of permissioned servers, and a token \n\nlinked to legal tender for transactions. \n\nThe most important components of those future applications could become \n\nthe cryptography behind personal IDs, the time stamps that make data irrevers\n\nible, and the open source character of the platform. These applications would not \n\neliminate trusted intermediaries, they would make more competition between \n\nintermediaries possible. Digital platforms like Facebook, Uber, Airbnb, and Ama\n\nzon use proprietary software and organize their own user IDs; the veracity of \n\ntheir data is not protected through decentralized storage. All these platforms can \n\ngain natural monopoly power because of network effects, because the platforms \n\nbecome more useful and more powerful if more people pa",
    "rticipate. A standardize \n\nsystem of digital IDs and open-source networks could break that monopoly and \n\nincrease entry opportunities. Experiments with P2P digital interactions are very \n\nimportant for this reason. Even if current applications do not stand the test of \n\ntime, the ultimate result could well be transformational. \n\nBlockchain applications in Europe and Central Asia \n\nMany countries in ECA have provided fertile ground for cryptocurrencies and \n\nblockchain technologies, especially since late 2016. When cryptocurrencies \n\nemerged, almost 10 years ago, activities were small-scale. As everywhere else in \n\nthe world, early transactions were used largely for gambling or for the purchase \n\nillegal products on the dark web (figure 2.5).^11 \n\n\n38 ● World Bank ECA Economic Update May 2018 \n\n The use of cryptocurrencies intensified at the end of 2016, especially for large cross-border transfers. When the prices of cryptocurrencies skyrocketed in 2017, investments in mining capacity ",
    "increased sharply and people began investing in cryptocurrencies in the hope of benefitting from further price rises. Investments in blockchain technologies surged. Governments in many ECA countries began experimenting with blockchain to improve their services. Some central banks are studying the issuance of legal tender in the form of digital currency, and financial institutions are piloting blockchain applications to incorporate them in the existing financial architecture. ECA has become an important center for ICOs. In terms of the number of projects, the Russian Federation ranks third globally (with 8.8 percent of all projects), Switzerland fifth (6.9 percent), Estonia seventh (3.0 percent), and Lithuania eighth (2.8 percent) (figure 2.5).

It has resulted in much lower savings at banks than in other parts of the world (Gould and Melecky 2017). Households are looking for alternative saving options. Another reason for the use of blockchain technologies in ECA is the desire to develop alternative means of transferring large funds. Russia is the largest issuer (more than $956 million)—followed by the United States ($811 million) and Switzerland ($514 million)—because of the $850 million raised for the TON blockchain.^13 One of the goals of that ambitious project is to provide an alternative to the SWIFT international interbank payment system (Aris 2017). Russia also has the largest number of users of the digital wallet on blockchain.com (UNDP 2018). Despite these examples, it is doubtful that I",
    "COs will have a broader application as venture capital if security is not built in for investors. Established financial centers are striving to adjust to meet the competition from a disruptive technology like blockchain. Switzerland is leading in adjusting financial regulations to cover ICOs, ensuring that they are incorporated into the existing financial architecture rather than developed as an outside alternative (see Atkins 2018a, 2018b; Financial Times 2018). Its aims to become a cryptocurrency and blockchain hub is reflected in its vibrant ICO activities. For example, Sirin Labs raised $157 million for the development of a blockchain-based smartphone. In line with these developments, a Swiss foundation, advised by Jacob Frenkel, chairman of JPMorgan Chase International, and Nobel laureate Myron Scholes, raised $50 million to develop a cryptocurrency backed by Special Drawing Rights (SDRs). Saga would have a stable value and be integrated into the existing financial sector, includi",
    "ng anti-money-laundering checks, with deposits in the International Monetary Fund’s SDR holdings. France is also planning a regulatory framework for ICOs (Aris 2017). Governments in ECA are accumulating in-house experience with blockchain pilots to improve government services. Estonia, Georgia, and Ukraine have experimented with blockchain to set up land and real estate registries. They are still searching for more specialized and more efficient designs, but the experiments have given a boost to efforts to digitize government services. Some government banks in ECA are seeking to improve their services through the use of blockchain technologies. The Russian state-owned VEB bank is piloting a new blockchain-based payment system with the regional government of Kaliningrad (Milano 2018). Another state-owned bank, Sberbank, is partnering with Russia’s federal anti-monopoly service to use blockchain technologies to store and transfer documents. Official bodies in ECA are investing in blockch",
    "ain research to improve services. The European Commission has funded a blockchain observatory to encourage blockchain technologies and help formulate policy recommendations, especially for smart contracts and the improvement of government services (Young 2017; Nicholson 2018). Lithuania has opened a blockchain center to incubate start-ups, partnering with similar centers in Melbourne and Shanghai (MediTelegraph 2017). Separately, the central bank of Lithuania offers a one-year sandbox environment for start-ups that develop new digital financial technologies. Estonia is exploring opportunities to use blockchain technologies in medicine \n\n\nChapter 2: Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain: Hype or Transformational Technologies? ● 41 \n\n(https://e-estonia.com/).Georgia is investigating the possibility of supporting \n\nsmart contracts.

Seemingly more than in other parts of the world, governments in ECA are restraining natural monopolies of tech giants.

    "anecdotal evidence presented here suggests that there may be multiple explanations for the blockchain activities in Europe and Central Asia: \n\n- In the eastern part of the region, market-based financial sectors are relatively     new and have not fully matured. Insurance and capital markets are underde-     veloped. Land registration and cadasters of real estate can still be improved.     Blockchain technologies could help fill these gaps. \n\n- Vulnerabilities in the banking sectors after the transition in 1991, the global     financial crisis in 2008, and the plunge in oil prices in 2014 have eroded trust     in financial institutions. In the eastern part of the region, bank deposits are     exceptionally low, and consumers are looking for alternative ways to invest     their savings (Gould and Melecky 2017) \n\n- Throughout the region, banks dominate financial sectors. Venture capital that     does not require collateral is scarce. New forms of fund raising could help tech     start-ups",
    " that have a potential to grow quickly in competitive global markets. \n\n- Demand for new ways of making cross-border transfers is strong. Remittanc-     es are large in the region; the high transactions costs associated with them is     onerous. The region also has a large share of illicit financial flows, linked to     money laundering, tax evasion, and the circumventing of capital controls or     sanctions. \n\n- Governments in the region provide a broad range of services. They oversee     elaborate social security systems, and most of them play an integrating role in     health care, pensions, and education. There is continuous demand to make     these services more efficient and more transparent. Many governments are     experimenting with blockchain technologies to achieve those goals. \n\n- Governments in the region are looking for ways to break the power of large     tech companies and increase privacy. \n\n It is unclear which experiments will have a lasting impact. The transformatio",
    "nal impact may come from applications that are very different from the original blockchain design. The blockchain experiment has already boosted innovation and competition, in both the private sector and government. For that reason alone, blockchain experiments deserve support. ECA is active in the mining of cryptocurrencies. Georgia is home to one of the largest mining companies of the world (Bitfury) as well as many smaller miners (box 2.3). Bitfury, which is building additional facilities in Canada, Iceland, and Norway, controls about 10–15 percent of global mining. \n\n\nChapter 2: Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain: Hype or Transformational Technologies? ● 43 \n\nCryptocurrency mining and the demand for electricity in Georgia \n\n Mining of cryptocurrencies is surprisingly widespread in Georgia, thanks to tax exemptions and low electricity prices. Indeed, Georgia has had the fastest-growing electricity consumption per capita in all of ECA since 2009 (box figure 2.3.1). This process was jump",
    "started when Bitfury, one of the world’s largest bitcoin miners, built a 20MW data center in Gori and a 40MW mining facility in Tbilisi, with funding from the Georgian Co-Investment Fund. The Tbilisi facility, located in a free industrial zone, has daily revenue of $250,000– $400,000. Bitfury recently sold this facility to its Chinese partner, Asian Chong Sing Holdings. It is now building mobile data centers to be sold to other investors. Other companies have built mining facilities in free industrial zones in Kutaisi. Many households have joined mining pools. Surveys indicate that up to 5 percent of households in Georgia are engaged in cryptocurrency mining or investments. These mining activities have had a striking impact on electricity consumption, turning Georgia from a net exporter to a net importer of electricity. Estimates of the share of Georgia’s electricity demand devoted to cryptocurrency mining range from 10 to 15 percent—and the figure could be even higher, because it is d",
    "ifficult to observe small-scale mining activities. Per capita electricity consumption in Georgia was 3,343 KWh in 2016, almost three times higher than in countries with similar levels of per capita income. Even after correcting for historically high electricity consumption in Georgia (likely because of the availability of inexpensive hydropower), energy use in recent years is remarkable. Between 2014 and 2016, per capita energy consumption increased by 655 KWh, of which only 65 KWh can be explained by rises in income. Some 590 KWh, or 18 percent of total demand, remains unexplained. Even before 2015—actually, since the start of bitcoin, in 2009— the unexplained part of electricity demand was rising (box figure 2.3.2). \n\nBOX 2.3 \n\n Source : World Development Indicators and the International Energy Agency. \n\n 10 8 6 4 2 0 –2 –4 –6 –8 \n\n Georgia \n\n Kyrgyz Republic \n\n Azerbaijan \n\n Kazakhstan \n\n Albania \n\n Turkey \n\n Armenia \n\n Bosnia and Herzegovina \n\n Latvia \n\n Turkmenistan \n\n Malta \n\n Es",

Armenia is set to be home to a 50MW mining farm (Murphy",
    " and Stafford 2018). Slush Pool, a bitcoin mining pool with a market share of about 7 percent and many participants from all over the world, is run by Satoshi Labs, a mining company based in the Czech Republic. KnCMiner is a mining pool in Sweden. Another mining pool is in Russia. Cryptocurrency mining thrives in a cold climate (avoiding the need for cooling) and in areas where electricity costs are low. En+ Group, a Russian energy company, is preparing to offer electricity to cryptocurrency miners at five plants in Siberia (Marson 2017; Helms 2018). The electricity capacity available for miners could well dwarf the capacity of existing mining facilities in ECA. EN+ could attract Chinese miners, who are currently dominant players in the global market but find a less and less hospitable environment in China. \n\nBOX 2.3 (continued) \n\n Of course, the mining of cryptocurrencies also raises incomes. Mining revenues in Georgia could well contribute several percentage points to GDP, even if th",
    "ese revenues are not registered as part of GDP (if they were registered, they would probably be classified as exports). What is observable is \n\n the additional consumption and imports not only of electricity and computer parts but also of more general consumption financed by the mining revenues. This increase is similar to the increase in consumption as a result of large inflows of remittances. \n\n It would be interesting to see how the financing of these activities shows up in the balance of payments. Revenues in cryptocurrencies are likely exchanged into legal tender at exchanges abroad, after which part of the legal tender is transferred back to Georgia. Investment opportunities in mining cryptocurrencies likely attract foreign direct investment. It is too early to draw conclusions about the spillovers to other sectors of the economy. It may trigger other innovative activities, or it could crowd out investments in other activities. \n\n FIGURE B2.3.2 Unexplained electricity demand in G",

They bode well for the development of other ap\n\nplications of these technologies. But the heavy electricity use by companies that \n\ncompete for the right to mine cryptocurrencies is a growing problem. How to \n\naccommodate and mitigate growing electricity demand from cryptocurrency \n\nminers and prepare for future declines in demand if mining activities relocate or \n\nm",
    "ining stops altogether in its current form are the most urgent challenges as \n\nthese markets develop. \n\nThere are multiple approaches to meeting these challenges. The cryptocur\n\nrency community is looking for more efficient ways to update the blockchain. \n\nGovernments are reconsidering their tariff policies; in order to curtail energy use, \n\nthey need to raise electricity tariffs for miners or create more market-based mech\n\nanisms to determine tariffs. If unchecked, electricity use could rise before alterna\n\ntives are found, possibly resulting in long-term damage to the environment. In \n\naddition, the fiscal costs of investments in power plants (or contingent liabilities, \n\nwhere new power plants are developed in partnership with the private sector) \n\ncould threaten public finances if demand for electricity driven by cryptocurren\n\ncies collapses. \n\nPolicy challenges \n\nCryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies pose difficult challenges for pol\n\nicy makers. There is no regulatory fram",
    "ework for transfers made with cryptocur\n\nrencies or smart contracts. Transfers occur outside anti-money-laundering com\n\npliance programs, and smart contracts are not subject to consumer protection \n\nlaws or financial oversight. \n\nTax codes do not fully cover the new markets if cryptocurrencies are not rec\n\nognized in the law as payment systems but are instead viewed as commodities. \n\nIt is difficult to determine the geographic location of the value added created by \n\ncryptocurrency mining. Tax legislation therefore has to be adjusted to incorporate \n\nthese new activities into direct and indirect tax systems. \n\nAnother ambiguity for policy makers is whether these new activities should \n\nbe supported or constrained. Should they be encouraged because of positive ex\n\nternalities and first-mover benefits? Or should they be constrained, because they \n\ncrowd out investments with greater social return? \n\nAnother pertinent question for policy makers is whether and how they can \n\nuse these techn",
    "ologies to improve their own services. \n\nIt is too early to offer specific advice, because there is still great uncertainty \n\nabout the future of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies. But experi\n\nences with other digital technologies—such as e-commerce, digital platforms, \n\nand the sharing economy—suggest that the following general guidelines should \n\nbe followed. \n\n_- Give the new technologies space, and avoid imposing restrictive legislation before_ \n\n initial ambiguities are resolved. Even if these technologies are ultimately unsuccessful, the experiments can help develop entrepreneurial skills, put competitive pressure on more traditional activities, and trigger innovations in other \n\n\n46 ● World Bank ECA Economic Update May 2018 \n\n sectors. A dynamic business climate should encourage innovations, experiments, and risk taking. \n\n_- Make implicit subsidies explicit, and be clear about risks._ If activities are not yet     covered by the tax code or are undertaken in special ",
    "economic zones, the im-     plicit subsidy and its temporary nature should be calculated and made public.     Consumers should be warned about risks, such as the risks associated with     volatile cryptocurrencies. \n\n_- Start planning for leveling the playing field._ If these technologies become success-     ful, they should be integrated into the formal economy. Tax codes and regula-     tions should be adjusted, so that both old and new technologies operate on a     level playing field. 14 \n\n_- Innovate as government._ The corporate motto “think big, start small, quit soon,     and scale fast” is relevant for governments, too. Blockchain technologies pro-     vide a stimulus to further digitize government services. Most successful gov-     ernments are bold in their ideas, know when to terminate experiments that are     not successful, and have the professionalism to quickly scale small experi-     ments that are promising. \n\n An undesirable side effect of the cryptocurrencies is the",
    " outsized use of electricity in mining. If mining companies pay a lower electricity price than the marginal cost of supplying more electricity, governments should consider raising tariffs or at least calculating the implicit subsidy. The sharp increase in electricity demand might be an opportunity to develop an electricity market with intra-day price fluctuations, so that price differentiation reflects actual costs. Uncertainty about future electricity demand for cryptocurrency mining warrants a rethinking of contingent liabilities of governments where additional power plants are built by public-private partnerships. Guarantees related to future demand for electricity used in cryptocurrency mining are riskier than for other electricity demand. At some point, electricity tariffs for mining could be used as indirect taxation of the value added created by miners. Although it is difficult to determine the geographic location of the output of these activities, it is easy to locate the input",
    "s. Ultimately, financial oversight will cover cryptocurrencies and smart contracts. This process will be a gradual one of trial and error, and it will depend on the direction in which blockchain applications develop. First steps have already been taken, in the United States (where bitcoin can be traded on futures markets), in Switzerland (where regulation of ICOs was proposed), and in the Netherlands (where guidance was provided about the tax treatment of cryptocurrency holdings). Oversight to prevent money laundering, tax evasion, pump-and-dump schemes, and illicit cross-border transfers focuses on transactions in which cryptocurrencies are exchanged for legal tender.^15 At some point, this oversight could extend to miners and other companies that update the blockchain. The ultimate goal of all these efforts is to create a level playing field, so that blockchain application can be integrated into existing markets. The long-term outcome could be that supervision becomes much more effec",
    "tive, because the transparency of the blockchain could provide supervisors and courts with access to real-time information. This access would also make it easier to develop valuable early-warning systems. \n\n\nChapter 2: Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain: Hype or Transformational Technologies? ● 47 \n\nThe many experiments and brainstorms by governments and central banks \n\nthroughout the region are inspiring. Just as blockchain opportunities put com\n\npetitive pressure on private financial sectors, they also trigger creative thinking \n\nin governments. It is important that these experiments not consider current \n\nblockchain designs as the full universe of possibilities. Even if decentralized \n\nmaintenance of digital government data can have major advantages, a permis\n\nsioned system seems much more appropriate and efficient for governments than \n\nthe original system that maintains the blockchain for cryptocurrencies. The ulti\n\nmate conclusion might even be that other data systems are better sui",
    "ted for spe\n\ncific applications than blockchain technologies, including in the creation of digi\n\ntal currencies by central banks (box 2.4). The flurry of experiments shows the \n\nsuccess of the blockchain revolution, but it also illustrates that progress may \n\ncome from innovations that are quite different from the original design and objec\n\ntive of the blockchain protocol. \n\nBOX 2.4 Will central banks issue digital currencies? \n\n Central banks are exploring the possibility of issuing digital money, for several reasons. First, the use of traditional cash is steadily declining (Rogoff 2014). Second, cryptocurrencies have provided a working digital alternative to cash, replicating the original characteristics of cash in digital format. Like cash, cryptocurrencies allow anonymous P2P transactions without involvement of middlemen. Third, demand for tokens that are linked to legal tender is increasing. These tokens could be used in the same way as cryptocurrencies but without the drawback of",
    " high volatility in their value. It seems a natural development to transform actual coins and banknotes into digital tokens with the same legal protection and subject to the same price stabilization as all money issued by central banks. a^ The transparency of transactions with central bank digital currencies could facilitate the systematic conduct of monetary policy (Bordo and Levin 2017). There are serious concerns about the issuance of digital money by central banks. Digital tokens issued by central banks could potentially replace not only cash but also electronic payment systems operated by commercial banks, which already offer electronic accounts, mobile money, and value cards. These systems can be uploaded and used offline. \n\n The Swedish central bank is exploring the possibility of making electronic accounts and value cards directly available to the public. The idea is to administer this digital money in a central register at the central bank. This proposal to replicate instrumen",
    "ts that already exist in the private sector stems from the understanding that the government has the legal obligation to provide means of payment to the public. It could, however, undercut the traditional financial intermediation role of commercial banks, which transform liquid liabilities into longterm assets. A central bank cannot take over the role of pooling liquidity to finance investments. If a central bank chose blockchain technologies to administer digital transactions in a decentralized way, it would compete more directly with cryptocurrencies, with the advantage of providing a token with a more stable value. Still, the system would differ fundamentally from the early cryptocurrency protocols. Supply of central bank coins would be endogenous—in order to link their value to legal tender—and seigniorage would accrue to the central bank. Such a system would undoubtedly become a permissioned blockchain, with only preselected servers participating (Danezis and Meiklejohn 2016). \n\n ",
    "a. Bech and Garratt (2017) provides a comprehensive overview of the differences between central bank digital currencies and cryptocurrencies. \n\n\n48 ● World Bank ECA Economic Update May 2018 \n\nNotes \n\n1. Electronic accounts are much more popular than cash. Central banks do provide elec-     tronic accounts to banks; they do not yet provide digital cash or electronic accounts di-     rectly to the public. \n\n2. The public key functions as a pseudonym in communications. The private key is used     to prove one’s identity. If this digital ID becomes a standard on open-source platforms, it     could make IDs and passwords on proprietary platforms like Facebook or Google redun-     dant. \n\n3. See, for example, the Georgian start-up Golden Fleece (https://goldenfleece.co/). \n\n4. Clark (2017) describes the early history of digital payment systems. \n\n5. A bitcoin address is an identifier of 26–35 alphanumeric characters that are equivalent to     unique IDs. Every transaction is recorded on the ",
    "public blockchain, so anyone can view     each address involved in each transaction. However, it is difficult to know the real iden-     tity of the people involved in the transactions. For this reason, the bitcoin network is of-     ten described as being pseudo-anonymous rather than completely anonymous. \n\n6. In the bitcoin protocol, a block can contain about 2,000 new transactions. \n\n7. The block rewards are hard-coded, but there is no guidance on what the fee should be.     As miners have discretion over which transactions to include, they select the transactions     with the highest fees. As the size of each block on the blockchain is limited to 1 MB     (roughly 2,000 transactions), if a user wants her transaction to be included in the next     block, she has to offer a high enough fee so that her transaction is among the approxi-     mately 2,000 that are selected. \n\n8. Other new concepts, often variations of the proof of stake, are proof of activity, proof of     burn, proof of",
    " capacity, and proof of elapsed time (Rooney 2018). \n\n9. The Austrian school and Keynesian economists have long debated the pros and cons of     private, decentralized money versus government-sanctioned legal tender. What is an     attraction for one group of economists (no reliance on governments, which are inclined     to impose an inflation tax) is a nightmare for the other (financial instability, lack of mon-     etary instruments). \n\n10. ZeroCash (http://zerocash-project.org/) is a good example of a platform that provides     more encryption. \n\n11. Silk Road, an online market for illegal drugs that used bitcoins, started in 2011. The FBI     took it down in 2014. \n\n12. The vulnerability of banks in oil-exporting countries after the fall in oil prices was one     of the reasons for the formation of the Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Association     (Dyussembekova 2017). \n\n13. This project is spearheaded by Pavel Durov, one of the founders of the Russian social     media platform Vko",
    "ntakte, and the encrypted messaging app Telegram (Khrennikov     and Voitova 2018). \n\n14. Carstens (2018) strongly advocates this point. \n\n15. Levin, O’Brien, and Zuberi (2015) discusses the regulation of cryptocurrencies. Bal     (2015) discusses tax issues. He and others (2016) provide a comprehensive overview of     all oversight measures. \n\n\nChapter 2: Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain: Hype or Transformational Technologies? ● 49 \n\nReferences \n\nAris, Ben. 2017. “Russia’s Blockchain Revolution.” _Moscow Times_ , October 6. https:// \n\n themoscowtimes.com/articles/eastern-europes-blockchain-revolution-59179. \n\nAtkins, Ralph. 2018a. “Swiss Authorities Tread Wary Path through CryptoValley.” _Financial_ \n\n Times , March 20. https://www.ft.com/content/bea458ba-25fc-11e8-b27e-cc62a39d57a0. \n\n———. 2018b. “Switzerland’s Stock Exchange Chairman Calls for ‘e-Franc.’” _Financial_ \n\n Times.

Key drivers were private investment a",
    "nd consumption. Investment dynamics reflected two large energy projects financed by FDI (the Trans Adriatic Pipeline and a hydropower plant). Private consumption was supported by a recovery in employment, wages and credit. Public consumption made a small contribution to growth, reflecting growth of the public sector wages. High tourism exports and recovering commodity exports more than compensated for the high investmentrelated imports of machineries and equipment as well as for the droughtrelated energy imports. Growth stimulated job creation. Employment grew by 2.9 percent in the first three quarters of 2017, following a strong expansion of 6.5 percent in 2016. Labor force participation increased to 58 percent, up by 0.4 percentage points year-on-year. Besides improved employment prospects, the increase in labor force participation may reflect the Government’s antiinformality campaign – including increased audits and higher penalties for non-compliance. The unemployment rate declined",
    " by 1.7 pp to an average of 13.9 percent in the first three quarters of 2017. Real wages in the formal employment have started to pick up in 2017 in construction, energy, and tourism. Poverty is estimated to have declined as growth and employment continued to \n\n pick up. The poverty rate (measured as US$ 5.5/day, 2011 PPP) is estimated to have decreased in 2017 to 32.8 percent, compared to 33.9 percent in 2016. Labor force participation of women, particularly young women, has started to decline throughout 2017, a trend that needs to be closely monitored to avoid reversing previous gains. Fiscal policy supported a reduction of public debt, but the pace of fiscal consolidation slowed in 2017. The 2017 fiscal deficit is estimated at 2 percent of GDP, slightly above the deficit of 1.8 percent in 2016. Revenue gains, from increased economic activity and the recovery of commodity prices, were estimated at an additional 0.9 percent of GDP in comparison to 2016. On the expenditure side, under-",
    "execution of public investments and lower interest expenditures partially compensated drought-related emergency support to the electricity sector and higher local governments spending. Prudent fiscal policy supported the public debt decline to 71 percent of GDP in 2017, compared to 72.4 percent in 2016. The Bank of Albania’s (BoA) policy stance continues to be accommodative and credit growth recovers. Average inflation picked up to 2 percent in 2017, but remained below the BoA’s 3 percent target, prompting no changes in the policy rate, which remains at 1.25 percent since May 2016. Underlying price pressures have remained subdued, helped by an appreciation of the national currency relative to the euro by 1.7 percent in 2017. The restructuring of NPLs from large borrowers and mandatory write \n\n- offs led to a decline in the NPL ratio to 13.2 \n\n#### ALBANIA \n\n FIGURE 1 Albania / Real GDP growth and contributions to real GDP growth \n\n FIGURE 2 Albania / Actual and projected poverty rates ",

Notes: See Table 2. \n\n Growth is estimated to have strengthened at 3.8 percent in 2017 supported by investments and is projected to moderate to 3.6 percent in 2018 as large FDI-financed energy projects wind down; growth will be driven by household consumption, and a pickup in exports. Growth created jobs, contributing to poverty reduction. Public debt declined in 2017, but the pace of fiscal consolidation slowed. Fiscal consolidation, improvement in spending efficiency, and implementation of structural reforms remain critical to fostering confidence and growth. \n\n Table 1 2017 P o pulatio n, millio n 2.9 GDP , current US$ billio n 1 2.5 GDP per capita, current US$ 4297 Internatio nal po verty rate ($ 1.9)a^ 0.9 Lo wer middle-inco me po verty rate ($ 3.2)a^ 6.6 Upper middle-inco me po verty rate ($ 5.5)a^ 34.7 Gini co efficienta^ 32.1 Scho o l enro llment, primary (% gro ss)b^11 3.7",

The current account deficit is esti- mated to have widened, reaching 8 per- cent of GDP in 2017. FDI-related invest- ments in the energy sector and drought- related electricity imports increased im- ports. Tourism and commodity prices increased the value of exports. The result- ing financing needs were covered by sig- nificant FDI inflows. With much of the financing coming through FDIs, external debt declined by 2 percentage points reaching 70.4 percent of GDP in 2017. For- eign exchange reserves have remained stable, covering 6 ½ months of imports of goods and services. \n\n###### Outlook \n\n Growth is projected to moderate to 3.6 percent in 2018, as two large FDI projects in the energy sector wind down, and then average 3.5 percent in the period 2019-20. As the demand stimulus from the large \n\n energy FDI projects winds down and economic activity increases to close to potentia",
    "l, growth will moderate. Growth will be increasingly relying on private consumption, supported by improved labor market conditions, and net exports supported by improved foreign demand. Investment will continue to support growth, reflecting a public investment drive to reduce infrastructure gaps and private investment, reflecting structural reforms and improvements in the business climate. Labor market improvements will support private consumption. Poverty is expected to decline from 31.3 percent in 2018 to 29.5 percent in 2019. Sustained fiscal consolidation and structural reforms are expected to gradually reduce the fiscal deficit to 1.5 percent of GDP by 2020, and the debt-to-GDP ratio to 60 percent of GDP by 2022. Under the Government medium term fiscal framework, fiscal consolidation will continue until 2021 – lowering expenditures on personnel, operational and maintenance, social outlays and local governments. On the revenue side, the introduction of a newly valued property tax i",
    "n 2018 is expected to yield additional revenues. While the government is planning sustained capital expenditures at 5 percent of GDP \n\n over the medium term, it has also announced sizable investments financed through public private partnerships (PPPs) to be contracted starting from 2018. \n\n###### Risks and challenges \n\n Economic prospects are vulnerable to downside risks. Given high public debt, the government needs to implement fiscal consolidation and strengthen tax compliance to preserve the macro-fiscal stability as a foundation for growth. The Government needs to strengthen its PPP management framework to contain fiscal risks from PPPs and to ensure that investment is cost-effective. Harnessing growth will require progress on structural reforms improving the business climate including judiciary, financial and energy reform \n\n- , strengthening the skills of its labor force \n\n- and removing barriers to jobs for the population. Lower than expected growth in trading partners and highe",
    "r global in- terest rates are also key risks for Albania’s growth and public finances. Reforms should be informed by equity considera- tions to ensure continued poverty reduc- tion and inclusion. \n\n TABLE 2 Albania / Macro poverty outlook indicators (annual percent change unless indicated otherwise) \n\n 2015 2016 2017 e 2018 f 2019 f 2020 f Real GDP growth, at constant market prices 2.2 3.4 3.8 3.6 3.5 3.5 Private Consumption 1.1 2.9 1.7 2.7 2.7 3.5 Government Consumption -1.1 3.8 2.3 1.2 0.4 0.6 Gross Fixed Capital Investment 4.0 6.0 6.8 3.5 3.1 1.9 Exports, Goods and Services 1.0 13.0 7.5 6.5 6.5 6.3 Imports, Goods and Services -2.9 7.4 5.7 4.8 4.8 4.9 Real GDP growth, at constant factor prices 3.1 3.4 3.7 3.6 3.5 3.5 Agriculture 0.8 0.7 0.8 1.5 1.8 1.8 Industry 5.1 3.2 3.5 3.6 4.2 4.2 Services 3.4 5.1 5.5 4.9 4.0 4.1 Inflation (Consumer Price Index) 1.9 0.9 2.0 2.1 2.3 2.8 Current Account Balance (% of GDP) -7.8 -6.8 -8.0 -7.1 -6.9 -6.7 Financial and Capital Account (% of GDP) 6.4 5.",

    "performance outperformed expectations in 2017, recording the highest rate of growth since 2007. Following a flat economic performance in 2016, real GDP expanded by 7.5 percent, mainly driven by a recovery in the external environment. Growth was also supported by a strong rebound in domestic demand. Consumption benefited from higher incomes—buoyed by a boost to remittance inflows of about 12 percent year on year and nominal average wage growth of 3 percent—which also benefited poor and vulnerable households. On the production side, growth was driven by a significant expansion in trade (16 percent), industry (10 percent) and services (9 percent). Also the construction sector showed modest growth (3 percent), but output remains below its pre-crisis level of 2008. The agriculture sector shrunk (by 4 percent), due to unfavorable weather conditions. A period of deflation came to an end in 2017 and inflation began rising, reaching an annual rate of 2.6 percent by year-end, within the central ",
    "bank's inflation target of 4 percent (+/1.5 percentage points). Recovering domestic demand, gradually rising commodity prices and excise tax hikes resulted in higher prices for food, beverages, cigarettes, and transport, affecting the purchasing power of poor and vulnerable groups, which traditionally spend a higher share of their budget on these items. \n\n The fiscal deficit narrowed slightly in 2017, to 4.7 percent of GDP (down from 5.5 percent in 2016), but remained wider than the budgeted deficit of 2.8 percent of GDP. While tax revenue increased by 7.3 percent year on year in 2017 —driven by higher collections of excise taxes, customs duties and environmental taxes—as a percentage of GDP revenue declined by 0.8 percentage points compared with 2016. Capital expenditure rose by 36 percent year on year in nominal terms, but tight control over current spending resulted in a decline of 1.6 percentage points in overall expenditure as a share of GDP. At the end of 2017, public debt (inclu",
    "ding CBA debt) totaled almost 59 percent of GDP. The current account deficit continued to narrow for a third consecutive year and is estimated to have fallen to under 2 percent of GDP in 2017. The improvement in the current account was driven by a strong increase in export earnings (up 25 percent year on year)—particularly from minerals and processed food products— robust growth in tourist arrivals and exports of other services (such as ICT), and improvement in the income account. The strong inflows were partially offset by a significant increase in import spending (28 percent year on year), a large share of which comprised capital imports linked to investment. Banking sector performance remained solid, with a capital adequacy ratio of just under 20 percent on average at end-2017, well above the minimum requirement of 12 percent. At the end of 2017, the nonperforming loan ratio stood at 5.5 percent, its lowest level since the 2014 Russian \n\n Table 1 2017 P o pulatio n, millio n 3.0 GDP",

    "by 260 basis points over the course of 2017. The economic recovery in 2017 is expected to have supported a further reduction in poverty rates, which have been on a declining trend since the global economic crisis. The absolute poverty rate (measured at the 2011 PPP-adjusted US$3.2/day poverty line) is estimated to have fallen from 14.1 percent in 2016 to 11.6 percent in 2017. \n\n###### Outlook \n\n Armenia's economic outlook remains positive. The strong performance in 2017 suggests the opening of a window of opportunity to undertake the reforms needed to make growth inclusive and sustainable. On the assumption of sustained favorable external economic conditions and robust structural reforms, medium-term growth is forecast to be around the potential growth rate (4 percent), supported by private-sector, export-led activity. In particular, the agribusiness, information and \n\n communication technology (ICT), and tourism sectors are expected to deliver solid growth as efforts to boost competit",
    "iveness and connectivity start to deliver results. As the economy continues to grow and incomes rise—and remittance inflows continue to support livelihoods thanks to a benign external environment—the absolute poverty rate is forecast to decline to 8.1 percent in 2020. Although price pressures are forecast to increase in the short term, mainly due to higher customs duties and excise taxes on fuels starting in 2018, inflation is projected to remain within the official target range. The new Tax Code, which becomes fully effective in 2018, lays the foundation for better tax administration and higher tax revenues. Implementation of the upgraded fiscal rule (approved in December 2017) will result in stronger discipline for current spending and will provide some room to increase growth-friendly capital expenditures while also stabilizing and eventually reducing the public debt. \n\n###### Risks and challenges \n\n Armenia’s vulnerability to economic conditions in Russia and its other trading \n\n p",
    "artners—as well as its low level of export diversification—will remain high. Adverse shocks linked to the Russian recovery or metal export prices would have a negative impact on economic growth rates over the near to medium term. Fiscal slippage could trigger the need for sharper adjustments in public spending, undermining domestic demand and real economic activity. Fiscal policy should remain prudent to contain public debt levels. Avoiding fiscal procyclicality will help prevent macroeconomic imbalances and reduce the risks associated with overheating (including potential competitiveness losses) during periods of strong economic growth. Continuing coordination with the monetary authorities and the maintenance of a flexible exchange rate will be vital to avoid episodes of real exchange rate appreciation that can lead to losses in competitiveness. Sustaining robust economic growth will require bold structural reforms—such as providing a fair and competitive business and investment envir",
    "onment—to address fundamental problems in Armenia's economy. Increasing country-wide access to economic opportunities will help to boost household incomes and drive a further reduction in poverty, particularly in secondary cities where poverty is highest. \n\n TABLE 2 Armenia / Macro poverty outlook indicators (annual percent change unless indicated otherwise) \n\n 2015 2016 2017 e 2018 f 2019 f 2020 f Real GDP growth, at constant market prices 3.2 0.2 7.5 4.1 4.0 4.0 Private Consumption -7.8 -1.3 8.8 5.0 4.7 4.5 Government Consumption 4.7 4.1 9.8 4.3 3.7 3.5 Gross Fixed Capital Investment 2.5 -11.4 7.3 4.5 4.2 4.1 Exports, Goods and Services 4.9 19.1 23.2 10.1 9.8 9.5 Imports, Goods and Services -15.1 7.6 24.0 10.3 9.5 8.9 Real GDP growth, at constant factor prices 4.3 0.7 7.2 4.1 4.0 4.0 Agriculture 13.2 -5.8 -4.0 2.5 2.7 2.4 Industry 2.8 -0.9 8.0 5.4 5.2 5.1 Services 2.1 4.0 10.5 3.9 3.8 3.9 Inflation (Consumer Price Index) 3.7 -1.4 1.0 3.5 3.8 4.0 Current Account Balance (% of GDP) -2.",

    "Selected Country Pages ● 57 \n\n MPO 44 Apr 18 \n\n###### Recent developments \n\n The Azerbaijani economy had a very modest recovery in 2017, as a rebound in the non-oil economy was offset by a contraction in the oil sector due to substantial OPEC-led cuts in oil production and capacity constraints. In particular, the nonoil sector rebounded by 2.7 percent yearon-year (y/y), supported by benign public financing, stronger external demand, and improved confidence in response to recovering oil prices. With the exception of the construction sector, output increased in all non-oil sectors with strong y/y growth recorded in transport (8.5 percent), information and communication technologies (6.6 percent), tourism (5.9 percent) and agriculture (4.2 percent). On the downside, and despite higher oil prices, oil GDP contracted by 5 percent y/y. Annual end-year inflation declined from 15.6 percent in 2016 to 7.9 percent in 2017, as the effect of the exchange rate passthrough and the impact of administ",
    "rative tariffs dissipated. The high inflation rate recorded for food items (9.4 percent y/y) was due to a strong external demand for agricultural products. To curb inflation, the central bank continued to tighten the monetary policy stance by actively absorbing manat liquidity through the use of deposit auction operations and the issuance of notes. Higher oil prices, sluggish import growth, and expanded non-oil exports helped to improve Azerbaijan’s balance of payments in 2017. Exports expanded by 50 percent \n\n y/y, led by a rise in oil exports, as oil prices recovered (oil exports accounted for 90 percent of total exports), while imports rebounded by 3 percent y/y (compared to a drop in 2016). Non-oil exports increased by 22 percent y/y, supported by stronger external demand, mainly from Russia. The current account recorded an estimated surplus of 4.3 percent of GDP in 2017. The tightening monetary policy, improved external environment, and transfers from the Oil Fund to the central b",
    "ank helped to maintain a broadly stable exchange rate at 1.7 AZN per USD in 2017. As a result, the central bank’s reserves increased by 34 percent y/y in 2017 and totaled US$5.3 billion by end-2017. The Oil Fund’s assets rose by 8.02 percent y/y and totaled US$ 35.8 billion (about 87% of GDP) in January 2018, mainly due to higher oil prices and a portfolio revaluation. In June 2017, the Government of Azerbaijan (GoA) relaxed its fiscal consolidation program, and public spending was revised up to primarily inject capital equivalent to 0.7 percent of GDP in the Azerbaijan Deposit Insurance Fund 1. Higher budget spending is estimated to have widened the consolidated fiscal deficit (comprising State Budget, the Oil Fund, the Social Protection Fund and the Nakhchivan Government) from a nearly balanced position in 2016 to a deficit of 1.5 percent of GDP in 2017. There were signs of recovery in Azerbaijan’s financial sector in 2017, supported by the stabilization of the manat exchange rate an",

Benign public financing, improved confidence, and a favorable external environment supported non-oil economic growth, but this was offset by an OPEC-led decline in oil production. Going forward, growth is expected to strengthen, driven mainly by a fiscal stimulus, a rise in hydrocarbon prices, and an increase in gas exports. Social conditions remain a major source of concern, as real wages and spending on social protection programs declined in 2017. \n\n Table 1 2017 P o pulatio n, millio n 9.9 GDP , current US$ billi",

IBA’s external liabilities worth US$3.3 billion were converted into longer-term liabilities and the sovereign debt. High inflation adversely affected house",
    "hold incomes and reduced the real purchasing power. In 2017, the increase in the minimal cost of living and nominal average wages by 11.6 percent y/y and 6 percent y/y, respectively, was not sufficient to compensate for higher prices. As a result, poverty likely increased in 2017 and was probably worsened by the 50-percent cut in the coverage of the country’s most important social assistance program. \n\n###### Outlook \n\n Azerbaijan’s economy is projected to expand by 1.8 percent y/y in 2018, supported mainly by the fiscal stimulus. The growth is expected to accelerate in the medium term, driven by an expansion of natural gas production, as the main pipeline that will deliver gas to Europe from \n\n the Shah-Deniz II field will be operational by end-2018. Since the OPEC-deal is extended until the end of 2018, Azerbaijan’s crude oil output is not expected to decline much further. Moreover, average oil prices will firm up somewhat in 2018 relative to 2017 and are projected to stabilize at ro",
    "bust levels in the medium term. Non-oil GDP growth is expected to accelerate in 2018, fueled by an 83-percent y/y increase in budgeted public investment. Nevertheless, growth in the non-oil economy is expected to remain moderate due to a protracted recovery of the banking sector and a weak business environment. The GoA plans a fiscal stimulus in 2018 through boosting capital spending, which will be primarily financed by an increase in budget transfers from the sovereign wealth fund. The consolidated fiscal balance is likely to be slightly positive in 2018 and is estimated to average 1.3 percent of GDP in the medium term, as oil prices remain firm and gas exports rise. To contain inflation, the central bank needs to continue tightening monetary policy. Azerbaijan’s external sector is expected to continue to improve due to an increase in hydrocarbon production and a continuation of non-oil export growth, supported by a rise in external demand \n\n and enhanced government support to exporte",
    "rs of non-oil products. However, spending cuts on social protection, as well as a moderate economic recovery, are not conducive to poverty reduction. \n\n###### Risks and challenges \n\n Following the recovery in oil prices after the 2014-16 shock, the likelihood of a procyclical economic policy rather than economic reforms to stimulate growth is rising. The main challenge is to preserve the reform momentum induced by the shock and strengthen institutions to ensure the resilience of the economy to future external shocks. Moreover, progress on the structural reform agenda to stimulate private-sector participation and jobs creation remains limited. An adaptive and effective social protection system and programs aimed at productive inclusion of poor and vulnerable households are needed to reduce poverty. \n\n 1/ ADIF was established in 2007 to protect individual deposits when banks are closed. \n\n TABLE 2 Azerbaijan / Macro poverty outlook indicators (annual percent change unless indicated other",

In 2017, the economy grew at 2.4 percent y/y, a rebound from the contraction of 2.5 percent y/y in 2016. Modest economic growth in Russia and a gradual increase in commodity prices boosted merchandize exports and supported an increase in domestic business activity. On the demand side, real wage increases helped to increase household consumption by almost 6 percent in 3Q 2017 (vs. 6.5 percent fall in 3Q 2016). In the same period, growth of gross fixed capital formation recovered to 1.8 percent – mainly due to rebound of public investment – versus the dramatic fall by 18.9 percent in 3Q 2016. In 2017, annual average inflation slowed to 4.6 percent helped ",
    "by better anchored inflation expectations, moderation in administrative price adjustments, and imported disinflation. Moderating inflation has allowed the National Bank to cut its benchmark rate from 17 to 10.5 percent during 2017, leading to an almost twofold reduction in nominal lending rates in national currency. As a result, supply of new credit in nominal terms went up by almost 30 percent y/y. However, NPL levels remain at around 13 percent and a comprehensive NPL resolution mechanism is still not put in place. Quasi-fiscal expenditures continue to put pressures on public debt levels and external financing needs. Recorded primary \n\n budget surplus has been spent on repayment and servicing public debt in foreign currency, which amounted to US$3.26 billion, or 6.9 percent of GDP. Pressures were partially eased by the disbursement of the two tranches of the EFSD loan (totaling US$600 million), disbursement of a bilateral loan from Russia (US$700 million), and the issuance of Eurobon",
    "ds—US$1.4 billion in 2017, and US$0.6 billion in February 2018. Exports recovered, helping to bring down the current account deficit to 1.1 percent of GDP in January-November 2017 (vs 3.2 percent a year ago), yet driven by the primary income deficit of 4 percent of GDP. Real wage increases have stopped the deterioration of household incomes. In 2017, real wages and disposable incomes grew by 6.2 and 2.4 percent respectively, benefiting from lower inflation. Disposable incomes growth was the highest in Minsk, but also in regions with higher absolute poverty rates, such as Brest and Gomel. The hires-to-terminations ratio throughout 2017 exceeded that of 2016 by an average of 12 percent. The share of households below the official poverty threshold remained stable throughout the first three quarters of 2017. \n\n###### Outlook \n\n While the recovery is underway, annual economic growth rates are unlikely to exceed 3 percent. Improved household consumption and investment activity, along with gr",
    "adual increase in exports, will help \n\n#### BELARUS \n\n FIGURE 1 Belarus / Real GDP growth and contributions to real GDP growth \n\n FIGURE 2 Belarus / Actual and projected poverty rates and real GDP per capita \n\n Sources: World Bank Staff Calculations based on Belstat data.

Real incomes started to pick up, but accelerated wage growth, along with other fiscal stimulus, could pose risks to macro stability. Rising public debt levels and continued dependence on external financing make the economy vulnerable to macroeconomic shocks.

At the same time, persisting domestic structural bottlenecks related to unaddressed legacy issues of misallocation of capital and low export diversif",
    "ication will continue to constrain the growth potential. Weak foundations for a sustainable growth recovery imply that income per capita gaps between Belarus and its neighbors may widen as the economies of the Baltic States and Poland are projected to grow on average above 3 percent per annum. At the same time, modest growth would ease balance-ofpayment pressures, allowing to maintain a current account deficit between 2 and 3percent of GDP over the next three years. \n\n###### Risks and challenges \n\n Downside risks from external factors are coming from two sources. First, although the headline current account deficits have narrowed down, a public debt to GDP ratio \n\n is likely to remain close to a half of GDP in the medium term. Majority of gross external debt pertains to the public sector and is characterized by a heavy and uneven debt service profile with repayment peaks every few years. As the public debt is largely denominated in foreign currency, there is a risk of disorderly adjust",
    "ment in external imbalance due to tightening of global financial conditions. Second, Belarus remains vulnerable to changes in global commodity prices and in terms of its energy trade policy with Russia. Either of these developments would make it harder for the government to generate the foreign currency needed to service its debt. Belarus’s experience with the 2017 Eurobond issuance indicates that access to external market financing – in contrast to loans from Russia and China – comes at a high cost. A ten-year, US$0.6 billion tranche was priced at 7.625 percent, higher rates than the ones obtained by emerging economies. In 2018, the Government will allocate US$3.1 billion for external \n\n public debt repayments and service (or about 5.4 percent of forecasted GDP), while domestic obligations of the Government denominated in foreign currency add another US$0.7 billion (or about 1.2 percent of GDP). Downside risks from domestic factors relate to a possibility of a disorderly unwinding of ",
    "financial sector imbalances if mechanisms for addressing insolvent SOEs and NPL resolution are not put in place. In addition, there are risks to fiscal sustainability arising from existing quasifiscal deficits related to the excesses of the expansionary policies of the past. Reintroduction of short-term demand stimulus is risky, leaving little prospects for improving enterprise performance and strengthening of financing sector. The effects of lower interest rates are limited, as highly indebted enterprises are unable to invest more. Boosting productivity of available capital and labor remains a sustainable way to overcome prolonged stagnation of growth and incomes. \n\n TABLE 2 Belarus / Macro poverty outlook indicators (annual percent change unless indicated otherwise) \n\n 2015 2016 2017 e 2018 f 2019 f 2020 f Real GDP growth, at constant market prices -3.8 -2.5 2.4 2.9 2.7 2.5 Private Consumption -2.3 -3.9 2.5 3.0 3.1 3.1 Government Consumption -0.5 -0.6 1.3 0.8 1.3 1.3 Gross Fixed Capi",

Domestic demand remains the dom- inant driver of growth with consumption adding 3pp, investment 0.8 pp and im- ports 5.1pp. Improved external demand has supported exports growth, but a strong rise in imports is offsetting this momentum. With negative overall net exports, they are estimated to have sub- tracted from growth (-0.8 pp). Unem- ployment remains high, although some improvements are observed in the labor market. The unemployment rate fell from 25.4 percent in 2016 to 20.5 in 2017, driven by a fall in activity rate and a slight rise in employment. The decrease in unemploy- ment was more pronounced among work- ers with primary ed",
    "ucation (from 26 per- cent in 2016 to 18 percent in 2017), which should have made poverty recede in 2017. After almost two years of deflation, infla- tion started to pick up in 2017, owing mainly to the recovery of global oil price. The consumer price index increased by 1.2 percent year-on-year (y-o-y) in De- cember 2017. The biggest driver of the increase was transport, tobacco and rental housing. In contrast, prices decreased notably on alcohol, clothing, and telecom- munication services. Given similar growth in nominal salaries, the effect on real incomes was neutral. In 2017, the fiscal balance is expected to remain in surplus. The latest consolidated data project a 2.0 percent of GDP surplus in 2017, up from a deficit of 0.3 percent in \n\n2016. In 2017, revenues rose mainly due to stronger collection of indirect taxes while expenditure declined mainly be- cause of continued restraint on current government spending. At the same time, sluggish capital spending reflected imple- mentat",
    "ion delays. Current expenditures are expected to re- main on a downward, driven by the com- mitment of the authorities to reduce the wage bill. Total public debt in 2017 re- mained at 37 percent of GDP (external public debt was 27 percent of GDP) and consisted largely of concessional debt to international financial institutions. The latest available poverty data using the national poverty line is for 2015 and was estimated at 16 percent, very close to the 15 percent poverty rate estimated for 2011. Rural poverty (19 percent) was higher than urban poverty (12 percent). Behind the minimal movement in poverty in 2011 \n\n- 2015 there was a small positive effect of pensions on household incomes, coun- tered mainly by a decrease in employment rate and a decline in self-employment earnings. The implementation of new la- bor laws in both BiH entities, and continu- ation of support schemes for first-time job seekers are expected to improve labor markets outcomes in the coming years, hence also s",

As the BiH’s reform agenda advances, a moderate rise in exports is expected, but strong demand for imports implies that net external demand will continue to be a drag on growth. Remittances are likely to remain stabl",
    "e, and, together with progress on reforms, will underpin a gradual pickup in consumption, which will remain a major driver of growth. Investments in energy, construction, and tourism will support investment growth generally, as well as job creation in those sectors. Because of these dynamics, real GDP growth is projected to build up gradually from 3 percent in 2017 to 3.2 percent in 2018 and up to 4 percent in 2020. As poverty is strongly associated with unemployment and inactivity in BiH, for economic growth to translate into poverty reduction, improvements in labor market participation and employment will remain key. However, with high unemployment and the expectations of flat real wages due to the substantial remaining slack in the labor market , \n\n poverty is projected to decline only slowly over the next couple of years. The current account deficit (CAD) is forecast to rise slightly in 2018 as both imports and exports started to pick up in 2017. In the medium run, with improved pr",
    "ogress on ongoing structural reforms and higher demand for foreign savings, CAD is expected to deteriorate from 5.8 percent of GDP in 2017 to 6.8 percent of GDP by \n\n2020. Overall, in the medium term both fiscal and external deficits will persist un- til 2020. \n\n###### Risks and challenges \n\n Achieving prudent, efficient, and effective fiscal policy, addressing persistent unemployment and continuing to safeguard the banking sector, will remain central to the BiH reform agenda. Although external deficits continue to be moderate, on the fiscal side the tax burden is high, and public spending is inefficient, as evidenced by \n\n poorly-targeted benefits. Fiscal consolidation and provision of an effective safety net will not be effective if structural rigidities in spending are not addressed— especially the high public wage bill. However, support from the international partners can help the BiH authorities to deliver on their challenging reform agenda. Without continued implementation of str",
    "uctural reforms, it would be difficult to address rigidities in public employment, pensions, and debt. There are notable risks, both domestic and external. The main domestic risk is the challenging political environment, which makes structural reforms difficult in such areas as infrastructure, telecommunications, energy sector, and transport. It also raises risks to the economic outlook. Despite some delays, BiH has submitted a detailed Questionnaire to the European Commission, a major step towards becoming a candidate country. Main external risk for BiH remains slow growth in the EU and rising inflation in developed countries and interest rates. \n\n TABLE 2 Bosnia and Herzegovina / Macro poverty outlook indicators (annual percent change unless indicated otherwise) \n\n 2015 2016 2017 e 2018 f 2019 f 2020 f Real GDP growth, at constant market prices 3.7 3.1 3.0 3.2 3.4 4.0 Private Consumption 0.4 1.8 3.2 3.4 3.7 3.5 Government Consumption 0.8 1.8 3.6 5.5 6.3 4.2 Gross Fixed Capital Invest",

    "in 2017, only slightly lower than 3.9 percent in 2016. Consumption and investment were the main drivers of growth while the contribution of net exports was negative in 2017. Consumption was supported by a dynamic labor market, rising wages, and eased financial credit conditions. Investment expanded at a solid rate, despite slow implementation of public investment projects. On the production side, the greatest contributions to GDP growth came from manufacturing; construction; real estate; trade, transport, and tourism. Strong domestic demand and higher energy and commodity prices pushed inflation up. After three years of deflation, inflation turned positive to 2.1 percent in 2017. Fiscal performance remained positive on the back of improved revenue collection and lower than planned public investment spending. Tax revenues grew by 10 percent in 2017 compared with 2016 thanks to strong economic activity, better compliance, higher minimum wages and an increase in the pension contribution r",
    "ate. Like 2016, capital investment was well below expectations as implementation of EU funded projects remained slow. Instead of planned deficit of 0.6 percent of GDP, fiscal accounts were balanced for the second year in a row. The current account surplus narrowed to 3.9 percent of GDP in 2017 compared with 5.3 percent in 2016 follow\n\n ing the deterioration of the trade balance and lower EU transfers. At 72.1 percent, the employment rate (2064) reached record high levels while unemployment was close to pre-crisis levels. However, the working age population continued to shrink constraining the expansion of potential growth. Labor and skill shortages as well as rising minimum wages pushed overall salaries up about 9 percent compared with 2016. Strong labor market conditions supported continued improvement in poverty reduction. Poverty measured using the Upper Middle-Income Class line of $5.5 per day (in 2011 PPP terms) is estimated to have declined from 8.5 percent in 2015 to 7.5 percent",
    " in 2017 (see Notes to Table 2). However, income inequality in Bulgaria is the highest in the EU and has been increasing over the last few years, with the income of the richest 20 percent of the population equal to almost eight times that of the poorest 20 percent in 2015. The coverage and adequacy of the social transfer system remains low. Unemployment has declined significantly but regional variations and long-term and youth unemployment remain high. Inactivity among certain groups of the population persists and many citizens – including the elderly, people living in rural areas, and the Roma – are excluded from economic opportunities. \n\n###### Outlook \n\n GDP growth is expected to remain robust, reaching 3.8 percent in 2018.

Private consumption is expected to continue expanding thanks to tight labor markets and rising real estate prices in large cities. Going forward, GDP growth is projected to moderate to 3.6 percent in 2019 and 2020. Domes",
    "tic demand should remain the driver of growth with an increasing contribution of investment. The current account balance is likely to remain in surplus, but narrow net exports will continue to deteriorate and an expected slowdown in EU growth due to higher oil and commodity prices. The fiscal position is likely to weaken slightly in 2018 and 2019, reflecting plans for expansion of public investment and increasing wages and social assistance payments. Strong revenue collection, driven by further improvements in compliance and an increased pension contribution rate in 2018, is likely to support fiscal consolidation in the medium term. Lack of improvement in spending efficiency in \n\n health, public order, and infrastructure could undermine fiscal consolidation and limit the potential of public spending to enhance growth. Poverty reduction is expected to continue at a modest pace in the near term. Sustained improvements in employment and wages, as well as recent increases in the minimum pe",
    "nsion, should support real incomes and therefore further reductions in poverty. Poverty is projected to fall from 7.5 percent in 2017, as measured at $5.5 a day in 2011 PPP, to 7.0 percent in 2018, and to 6.3 percent by 2020. \n\n###### Risks and challenges \n\n Risks to the projected growth path are broadly balanced. Lower than expected European growth could undermine export growth, while tightening global financial market conditions could increase the cost of lending to the private sector with negative implications for investment. Continued wage growth at a faster pace than productivity could translate into increasing unit \n\n labor costs and therefore undermine competitiveness. Further acceleration of real estate prices in large cities could negatively affect the quality of bank portfolios. Upside factors likely to lead to higherthan expected growth are an enhanced economic sentiment in Europe and stronger global economic activity. The key challenges for Bulgaria are to accelerate conver",
    "gence with the rest of the EU and to build a more inclusive society. Accelerating convergence requires improvements in productivity and labor force participation as the demographic transition is weighing on the size of the working age population. Enhancing productivity growth requires addressing governance challenges (public administration, judiciary, business environment, governance of SOEs) that have undermined Bulgaria’s structural transformation. Enhancing the skills and employability of all Bulgarians, more effective and efficient public spending on health, pensions and long-term care are also needed to ensure inclusiveness and sustainability of growth in the face of demographic changes. \n\n TABLE 2 Bulgaria / Macro poverty outlook indicators (annual percent change unless indicated otherwise) \n\n 2015 2016 2017 e 2018 f 2019 f 2020 f Real GDP growth, at constant market prices 3.6 3.9 3.6 3.8 3.6 3.6 Private Consumption 4.5 3.6 4.8 5.2 4.7 4.5 Government Consumption 1.4 2.2 3.2 3.2 1",

Exports of goods and services was the main driver of growth in 2017. Tourism recorded exceptional performance with foreign tourist nights rising by over 11 percent, and strong growth of merchandise export continued. Private consumption also made a positive contribution to growth, supported by favorable labor market developments and personal income t",
    "ax rate cuts. However, the share of imported durable goods in consumption increased. On balance, the effect of net exports on growth turned negative. In addition, growth slowed down because investment growth decelerated markedly. This was mainly due to a weaker absorption of EU funds, which led to a sharp fall in government investments. Following deflationary pressures in 2016, prices increased by 1.1 percent y-o-y in 2017 on the back of the recovery of international oil and food prices. With inflation still subdued, the Croatian National Bank (CNB) continued to pursue an expansionary monetary policy throughout 2017. Fiscal consolidation also continued in 2017, with the budget surplus estimated at 0.1 percent of GDP, down from a deficit of 0.9 percent in 2016. The surplus was achieved by buoyant tax collection and constrained growth in expenditures in line with the November 2017 budget revision. The combination of a significant primary surplus and a small debt reducing interest \n\n- rat",
    "e growth differential resulted in a \n\n stronger than expected fall in the government’s debt ratio to 80 percent of GDP in 2017, down from 82.7 in 2016. External imbalances narrowed further as the current account surplus increased to 3.7 percent of GDP in September 2017 (on a four-quarter basis). This rise is expected to be only temporary, as it reflects a fall in banks’ profits resulting from their exposures to Agrokor Group. External debt (of the public and private sectors) declined to 84.2 percent of GDP in November 2017, 5.6 percent lower than 2016, as banks and the private corporate sector continued to deleverage. Employment rose across the board, with manufacturing, tourism and construction accounting for more than a half of the increase. Together with negative migration flows, this led to a marked decline of the survey-based unemployment rate to an estimated 11 percent in 2017, down from 13.1 percent in 2016. Real net wages increased by 4.2 percent y-o-y in December. The positive",
    " wage trends are due the recovery of firms' profitability, labor shortages in some sectors, a 6-percent rise in public sector wages and cuts in the personal income tax rate. Economic recovery and labor market improvements are now starting to reduce absolute poverty, after increasing during six subsequent years of economic recession. The poverty rate measured at the upper middle-income class poverty line of $5.5 at 2011 PPP per capita fell from 7.3 percent in 2013 to 5.8 percent in 2015, which is still higher than the precrisis rate. The poverty rate for 2017 is projected at 5.1 percent, suggesting that \n\n#### CROATIA \n\n FIGURE 1 Croatia / Real GDP growth and contributions to real GDP growth \n\n FIGURE 2 Croatia / Actual and projected poverty rates and real GDP per capita \n\n Sources: CROSTAT, World Bank.

While real per capita income has returned to its 2008 level, output is still about 4 percent lower than in 2008. Therefore, the rebound in per capita income reflects the impact of demographic trends. \n\n###### Outlook \n\n Growth is expected to slow further to 2.6 percent in 2018, due to a slowdown in private consumption as the favorable effects of the tax reform on real wages start to fade. Furthermore, exports of tourist services are expected to slow in 2018, due to capacity constraints. On the other hand, better absorption of EU funds will give a boost t",
    "o investment spending. These trends suggest an average economic growth of 2.8 percent for 2019 and 2020. The government balance is expected to stay in surplus and may reach 1 percent by \n\n 2020, leading to a further decline in public debt to below 70 percent of GDP. However, the overall fiscal stance will become moderately pro-cyclical, as the structural budget balance is expected to worsen. Positive labor market developments are expected to support the growth of disposable income for all segments of the welfare distribution. The continued decline in the share of long-term unemployed and NEETs will reduce the absolute poverty rate further to 4.0 percent in 2020. \n\n###### Risks and challenges \n\n Risks are slightly skewed to the downside. As the operational restructuring of Agrokor Group unfolds in 2018, the negative effects on investment activity and private consumption might be greater than currently envisaged. In addition, although the positive contribution of exports of \n\n goods to G",
    "DP growth is expected to stay high, it is exposed to the risk of a slowdown in external demand from the EU. Furthermore, the still high level of public debt makes Croatia vulnerable to interest rate shocks and worsening external financing conditions. Finally, the cyclical upturn and the sounder fiscal position may foster continued complacency. The lack of reforms would have an adverse effect on growth over the medium term. Croatia’s prospects for improving higher and more inclusive growth remain weak. Currently low potential growth calls for a strong structural reform agenda. Substantial economic, social and institutional weaknesses should be addressed to boost private sector productivity and competitiveness, raise the quality of human and physical capital and modernize public services. This would lead to increasing economic activity and employment, which are crucial for a further reduction in poverty. \n\n TABLE 2 Croatia / Macro poverty outlook indicators (annual percent change unless ",

GDP growth improved markedly to 5 percent—from 2.8 percent in 2016 —led by an improved external environment. Prudent macro-fiscal policies helped preserve fiscal space and supported price stability. Inflation spiked to 6.7 percent (eop) in 2017 in response to higher excise taxes on tobacco and fuel, but dropped to below 3 percent in February 2018. With ",
    "inflation above the ceiling of its target range in 2017 and rapid credit growth, the NBG increased the policy rate by 0.75 bps to 7.25 percent over 2017. Georgia’s external position improved considerably. Export of goods expanded by 24 percent on the back of strong demand from Russia, Azerbaijan, Ukraine, China, and the US; tourism proceeds rose by 27 percent; and worker’s remittances increased by 21 percent in 2017. Import growth was relatively lower, reflecting gradually the firming oil prices. Gross FDI inflows increased in 2017 to 12.3 percent of GDP, helping strengthen the international reserve position, which stood at 4 months of imports of goods and services. Total external debt remained high at 112 percent of GDP at the end September 2017. Fiscal policy was prudent. Despite eliminating the income tax on reinvested profits starting in 2017, revenues increased by 11 percent. To prioritize social and infrastructure spending, the authorities generated savings of about \n\n 0.8 percen",
    "tage points of GDP from reduced administrative costs in 2017. This helped to scale up public investments to 8.3 percent of GDP and slightly narrow fiscal deficit to 3.8 percent of GDP from the 3.9 percent observed in 2016. Georgia’s public debt remained sustainable at 44 percent of GDP as of end-2017. The banking sector is well capitalized, profitable and with low non-performing loans (NPLs), although structural vulnerabilities persist. The sector yielded a return on assets of 2.8 percent and a return on equity of over 20 percent as of end-2017. Also by December 2017, NPLs represented only 2.4 percent of gross loans, down from 3.6 percent as of end-2016. At the same time, systemic vulnerabilities persist, including the large market concentration by the top two banks, the high retail loan growth (including by non-bank financial institutions), and elevated dollarization, against the backdrop of deficient financial safety nets. NBG plans to address the latter issues with the support from ",
    "the WB and IMF. Poverty is estimated to have fallen in 2017, driven by an increase of employment opportunities related to the expansion of the construction and services sectors, resuming the decreasing trend started in 2010 (and which stalled in 2016). The spike in inflation in 2017 may have offset—albeit to a minor extent—the positive effect of employment on poverty by reducing households’ purchasing power. The most recent poverty figures available for the country are for the year 2016, when poverty was estimated at 17 percent using the lower-middle income. \n\n#### GEORGIA \n\n FIGURE 1 Georgia / Real GDP growth and contributions to real GDP growth \n\n FIGURE 2 Georgia / Actual and projected poverty rates and real GDP per capita \n\n Sources: Geostat and World Bank staff estimates.

The more benign external environment should facilitate the development of private sector-led export sectors, encourage FDI, and support consumption from still robust remittances. A steady implementation of the reform program will result in a further acceleration of growth over the medium term to 5 percent by 2020, particularly by enhancing productivity. Inflation is envisaged to remain well contained, converging to the NBG’s target of 3 percent by year-end 2018, while the current account deficit would narrow to below 9 percent of GDP by 2020. Conside",
    "rable consolidation of administrative spending, streamlining of subsidies and a more efficient social safety net will help to achieve medium-term fiscal consolidation while providing space for capital spending. Current spending is projected to decline from 24.5 percent of GDP in 2017 to 23 percent in 2020, primarily by containing the wage bill and administrative expenses—which rose steadily and steeply for at least 4 years—and better targeting of subsidies and social assistance \n\n programs. The fiscal deficit of the general government will be gradually reduced to 3.0 percent of GDP by 2020 keeping public debt stable. Still, fiscal slippages, or accumulation of new liabilities or materialization of contingent liabilities may compromise the expected consolidation and result in higher debt burden. Continuous expansion of the economy in upcoming years should lead to more employment opportunities and further poverty reduction. Employment opportunities outside agriculture in rural areas (in ",
    "particular) will play a critical role in leading to significant reductions in lagging regions. Pensions and social assistance are expected to play a much smaller role for poverty reduction in upcoming years, in contrast to the 2010-2015 period, given the more limited fiscal space. \n\n###### Risks and challenges \n\n Georgia’s quasi-fiscal risks emanating from the contingent liabilities of the StateOwned Enterprises (SOEs) are substantial and a source of vulnerability. The Fiscal Risks Annex to the 2018 Budget Law suggests that the liabilities of the 76 high and medium risk SOEs are around 20 percent \n\n of GDP. Additional risks stem from contingent liabilities generated by the government’s Power Purchasing Agreements (PPAs). At the end-2017 there were 72 signed PPAs, in which the state issues guarantees to purchase excess electricity from operators on a seasonal basis. While the fiscal risks of PPAs exist, the needs for additional power capacity are also evident from the consumption growth",
    " trend. The Government is committed to review carefully its decisions going forward, ensuring compliance of new PPAs with the draft Law on Public Private Partnerships that is expected to be approved and enacted in 2018. As a very open economy, Georgia is vulnerable to regional developments given its historically high current account deficit, and the risks of export demand and remittances shock. The downside risks to the baseline scenario are associated with further tightening of US monetary policy and Lari depreciation; deterioration in the external environment (including due to a weaker EU outlook) and regional geopolitical tensions. Rural poverty and high poverty rates in lagging regions also remain a challenge.

Real GDP growth accelerated to 4 percent in 2017, up from 1.1 percent in 2016. Oil production, which rose by 10.5 percent year on year in 2017, was the primary driver of this improvement. The increase in oil output was observed in the oil fields that were not covered by the OPEC-led cuts in 2017",
    ". Together with more favorable terms of trade, it generated positive spillover effects to the manufacturing and services sectors. While the agriculture sector contributed modestly to overall growth in 2017, growth of the construction sector slowed, largely reflecting the completion of oil transportation projects. On the demand side, growth was driven by an improvement of net exports, highlighting oil sector expansion and the recovery of global oil prices. The current account deficit narrowed substantially in 2017, to 3 percent of GDP (from 6.5 percent in 2016), buoyed by more favorable terms of trade. The improvement in the current account balance helped the tenge to strengthen by about 10 percent in real terms against the U.S. dollar in 2017. On the financing side, FDI inflows and foreign borrowing by state-owned enterprises were offset by short-term capital outflows. The central bank reported an increase of assets held by residents abroad. As a result, gross international reserves of",
    " the central bank and the government (in the oil \n\n fund) declined by nearly US$5 billion (3 percent of GDP). The government continued to consolidate its core fiscal accounts, but the overall fiscal deficit widened to 7 percent of GDP in 2017 as a result of the banking sector bailout. The government recapitalized the Problem Loans Fund with an injection of US$6.5 billion (about 4 percent of GDP) in 2017 to support the recovery of banks’ balance sheets; the central bank provided another US$2 billion to support ailing banks. The central bank continued to implement its inflation targeting policy. As the impact of the 2015 currency depreciation eased, consumer price inflation halved from an average of 14.6 percent in 2016 to 7.4 percent in 2017. With inflation easing, the central bank cut its policy interest rate three times in 2017 and two times in early \n\n2018. The latest rate cut, in March 2018, lowered the policy rate to 9.5 percent. The poverty rate (using the $5.5/day inter- national",
    " poverty line) rose from 5.6 per- cent in 2013 to a peak of 7.9 percent in 2016; it is estimated to have fallen to 6.9 percent in 2017. The incidence of poverty increased in all regions of Kazakhstan between 2014 and 2015, the last year for which data are available. Poverty rates in the most vulnerable southern regions more than doubled during this period, jumping from 5.2 percent to 13.9 percent in Kyzylorda oblast and from 5 percent to 12.5 percent in Jambyl oblast. Despite the economic recovery and im- proved consumer confidence, household income remained under pressure in 2017, as the labor market struggled to recover. Real wages and salaries declined by 2.1 \n\n#### KAZAKHSTAN \n\n FIGURE 1 Kazakhstan / Real GDP growth and contributions to real GDP growth \n\n FIGURE 2 Kazakhstan / Actual and projected poverty rates and real GDP per capita \n\n Sources: Statistical Office of Kazakhstan; World Bank staff estimates.

    "ncreased oil production supported the economic recovery and an improvement in poverty indicators in Kazakhstan in 2017. Over the medium term, the real GDP growth rate is expected to hover around 3 percent, as the oil sector’s contribution to economic growth declines relative to 2017 (when a structural shift in oil output occurred). Risks to the outlook include a potential weakening of the external environment, a worsening of problems in the banking sector, and a missed opportunity to deepen structural reforms. \n\n Table 1 2017 P o pulatio n, millio n 1 8.0 GDP , current US$ billio n 1 58.2 GDP per capita, current US$ 8792 Lo wer middle-inco me po verty rate ($ 3.2)a^ 0.4 Upper middle-inco me po verty rate ($ 5.5)a^ 7.8 Gini co efficienta^ 26.9 Scho o l enro llment, primary (% gro ss)b^11 0.6 Life expectancy at birth, yearsb^ 72.0 \n\n (a) M ost recent value (2015), 2011 PPPs. \n\n Source: WDI, M acro Poverty Outlook, and official data.

Although wages rose by 2.5 percent year on year in Astana, the capital—and by 1.6 percent and 1.9 percent in Pavlodar and Kostanay oblasts, respectively—these gains were more than offset by falling real wages in the rest of the country. The official unemployment rate remained unchanged in 2017 at 4.9 percent. \n\n###### Outlook \n\n As oil output growth stabilizes from 2018 onward, real GDP growth is expected to moderate to an average annual rate of 3 percent through 2020. Growth in the n",
    "ontradable services sector will be supported by stronger domestic demand as real incomes of households are expected to start recovering. Moreover, the planned additional investment in oil output expansion projects will drive an increase in construction activity. Assuming that there are no external shocks and that the authorities continue their inflation targeting regime, consumer price inflation will stabilize at between 4.3 \n\n- 5.3 percent in the medium term. As oil prices are projected to stabilize around US$60 per barrel in 2018-20, the \n\n current account balance and fiscal oil revenue are also expected to level off. The fiscal position will improve gradually in the wake of fiscal consolidation efforts. The government is planning to cut the non-oil fiscal deficit from over 13 percent of GDP in 2017 to 7 percent by 2020. As the economy continues to grow, labor income—the primary driver of poverty reduction in Kazakhstan—is forecast to return to positive real growth. As a result, the ",
    "poverty rate is projected to decline to 5 percent by 2020. The successful implementation of structural reforms will be required to deliver more sustainable and inclusive economic growth. The ongoing structural and institutional reforms (including those under the 100 Concrete Steps program and the Strategic Plan for Development of Kazakhstan to 2025, as adopted in early 2018) should aim to reduce the role of the state in the economy and facilitate the development of a vibrant, modern and innovative tradable non-oil sector. In this context, efforts to restructure and privatize stateowned enterprises would be expected to focus on improving the efficiency of public administration, reducing fiscal risks, and open contestable spaces for the private sector to act. Prudent fiscal and monetary policies would support economic \n\n and price stability and encourage investment in the non-oil economy. Higher incomes will also have positive spillover effects on poverty reduction. . \n\n###### Risks and ",
    "challenges \n\n Both external and domestic factors present risks to Kazakhstan’s medium-term economic outlook. The economy’s vulnerability to external shocks remains the main challenge to achieving stable and sustainable development. External demand from China and the Russian Federation, Kazakhstan’s main trading partners, as well as global oil demand and prices will remain the key external factors impacting Kazakhstan’s economic performance. Domestic factors include the pace of implementation of structural and institutional reforms, especially in anticipation of a political transition over the medium term. A potential escalation of problems in the banking sector is also a concern. To mitigate these risks and facilitate a sizeable expansion of the tradable non-oil sector’s role in the economy, the government must demonstrate significant improvements to the rule of law, the investment climate, and the quality of human capital. \n\n TABLE 2 Kazakhstan / Macro poverty outlook indicators (annu",

Investment ",
    "contributed 3pp to economic growth, with public investment increasing by 5 percent y-o-y. The recovery in goods exports was led by a rebound in commodity prices with a broad-based increase in volumes of goods exports, albeit from a low base, and a surge in the export of services. Net exports contributed a 1.1pp while the contribution of consumption was only 0.4pp. In terms of economic sectors, construction, trade, financial and transport were the main engine of growth in 2017 with a contribution of 2.6 pp. Agriculture remained stagnant, whereas industry contributed 0.7pp. Consumer price inflation was 1.5 percent in 2017 y-o-y, up from 0.3 percent in 2016, as prices for fuel, food, tobacco, alcohol, and other household items increased adding to the cost of living. Higher revenues (up 5.3 percent y-o-y) and under-execution of public investments narrowed the fiscal deficit to 1.4 percent of GDP in 2017, lower than the earlier projected 2 percent of GDP. Indirect tax revenues grew by 6.1 p",
    "ercent (VAT by 8.1 percent), while non-tax revenues grew by 5.6 percent y-o-y. Direct tax revenues added only 2.5 percent growth, \n\n due to a decline in CIT collections by 7 percent. Spending increased by 5.7 percent, due to a 11.9 percent increase in social transfers and 5.4 percent increase in capital spending. Higher actual costs than planned costs for spending on veterans benefits exceeded plans due to the delay in the implementation of the cap on the scheme. In addition, goods and services spending rose by 10.7 percent due to early elections and creation of two additional ministries. Public and publicly guaranteed debt remains on a rising trajectory, reaching 15.8 percent of GDP at end-2017. The current account deficit (CAD) improved to 5.1 percent of GDP in 2017, from 8.2 percent in 2016, thanks to better external conditions and increase in export volumes. Exports of goods jumped up by 23.1 percent y-o \n\n- y in 2017 due to higher growth of the trad- ing partners, and higher globa",
    "l prices of base metals. Exports of services grew by 17.7 per- cent in 2017, mainly due to higher travel expenditures by the diaspora. Higher growth continued to foster job crea- tion in 2017. Employment grew by 1.2pp y-o- y in the third quarter of 2017, however, as labor force participation expanded further, unemployment increased by 2.7 pp. Despite the recent improvements, employment is still low at 29.7 percent on average as a share of total population. The share of self-employed and unpaid family workers, i.e. those in vul- nerable employment and measures job quali- ty, remains high at 23 percent; the youth unemployment rate slightly increased reach- ing 53.3 percent in Q3 2017. The duration of unemployment is worrying with over 70 percent of the unemployed seeking a job for over a year. \n\n#### KOSOVO \n\n FIGURE 1 Kosovo / Real GDP growth and contributions to real GDP growth \n\n FIGURE 2 Kosovo / Actual and projected poverty rates and real private consumption per capita \n\n Sources: S",

Perceived fragility of the government, with only 61 out of 120 votes in the parliament, can slow down the implementation of public projects through the investment clause. In addition, the delay in fiscal reforms such as the implementation of the cap on the war veteran’s benefits, further increases in untargeted categorical social benefits, and unfunded early retirement schemes increase fiscal pressures. Reform priorities should include shifting sources of growth towards tradable sectors and in",
    "creasing productivity to address high unemployment, low participation rates, and poverty. \n\n###### Outlook \n\n Economic growth is projected at 4.8 percent in 2018 2020, propelled by higher capital spending. Growth in public investment is expected to be driven by several projects under preparation, including the railway project and regional roads financed by IFIs. Private investment is expected to increase reflecting improvements in the business environment, and increase in credit due to the partial credit guarantee fund for SMEs established in \n\n2017. Higher wages and social spending, growth in remittances and credit to house- holds are expected to promote household consumption adding an additional 2.3 pp to growth. Exports are likely to benefit from robust growth in Europe and higher base metal prices. However, net exports are projected to subtract 0.9 pp from growth in 2018 because of higher imports linked to public investment projects. \n\n The CAD is expected to reach 6 percent of GDP",
    " in 2018. Increased demand for investment goods is expected to widen the CAD in 2018, despite higher exports projected. Net FDI and remittances, are expected to finance larger shares of the CAD as growth in Europe firms up and larger implementation of the Stabilization and Association Agreement. Poverty, measured at the lower middleincome poverty line (US$ 3.2/day, 2011 PPP), is expected to decline slightly to 2.55 in 2018, from 2.6 percent in 2017 driven by stronger growth. High unemployment and inactivity rates remain the key impediments to sustainable poverty reduction. \n\n###### Risks and challenges \n\n Kosovo’s outlook is positive, but the risks are tilted to the downside.

    " accelerated to 4.5% in 2017, from 3.8% a year earlier. Growth was driven by the non-gold industry (22%) while it decelerated in other main sectors: gold, construction, agriculture and services. On the demand side, growth was supported by public investment, net exports and private consumption fueled by a steady rebound in remittances inflows. An expansionary fiscal stance was maintained, even as external tailwinds strengthened. The estimated overall fiscal deficit was 5% of GDP in 2017, down from 6.6% in 2016 and lower than the budgeted deficit of 7.5%, but still above the levels of previous years. Both tax and non-tax revenues increased as a share of GDP. In addition, the budget received rising grant support from international donors. At the same time, expenditures increased, driven largely by capital outlays. Substantial overruns in current spending in the first part of the year were partially mitigated by expenditure restraint in the last quarter of 2017. The deficit was mainly fina",
    "nced by foreign borrowing, which increased total public debt to 63.2% of GDP from 61.4% in 2016. The current account deficit is estimated to have narrowed to 9.4% of GDP in 2017 from 12.1% a year before, as exports picked-up (+14.5% in US dollar terms) and remittances continued to grow (by 24.2% in US dollar terms). The export performance was driven mainly by non-gold \n\n exports, which benefited from the recovery in regional demand as well as improved compliance by Kyrgyz producers with Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) quality standards. Imports are estimated to have risen by 12% (in US dollar terms), a slower increase than might have been envisaged given the improvement in remittances and high levels of public investment. The current account deficit was financed by FDI and government borrowing. International reserves increased slightly to US$2.1 billion, covering about 4 months of imports. The stronger balance of payments (and corresponding foreign exchange liquidity in the economy) led ",
    "to a further appreciation of the Kyrgyz som by 0.6% in 2017 (8.8% in 2016). In real effective terms, however, the som depreciated by 0.5%, largely reflecting relative inflation dynamics with key trading partners. Inflation rose slightly in 2017 reaching 3.7%, given buoyant domestic demand. With inflation still below the National Bank (NBKR) target of 5 7%, monetary policy remained accommodative. Economic activity was supported by a recovery in credit to the economy (14% growth), following a decline early in the year. The poverty rate (measured at below US$3.2 per day, 2011 PPP terms) is estimated to have fallen to 19% in 2016. Low consumer price growth and higher remittance inflows supported household consumption. At the same time, moderate growth in services and agriculture, where about 50% of the bottom 40 are employed, constrained real labor income growth for the poor. \n\n Table 1 2017 P o pulatio n, millio n 6.2 GDP , current US$ billio n 7.2 GDP per capita, current US$ 1160 Interna",

This scenario assumes that recovery takes hold in Russia and Kazakhstan, benefiting the Kyrgyz economy via the traditional remittance and trade channels. An additional boost is expected to come from exports, thanks to a number ",
    "of developments, which include: (i) enhanced access to the EEU market; and (ii) improved bilateral relations with Uzbekistan, which should lead to higher trade between the two countries. These effects should mitigate the anticipated moderation of public expenditure. Inflation is envisaged to remain in line with the NBKR target, assuming no significant global food price increases and relative exchange rate stability. While remittance inflows are expected to grow further, the current account deficit is projected to remain elevated at around 10% of GDP, reflecting structural features of the economy and continued high, albeit gradually moderating, levels of public investment. \n\n The fiscal deficit is projected to decline to 2.9% of GDP by 2020. This will be achieved through measures to increase tax revenues and curtail current spending, while capital expenditures would remain robust at about 7.6% of GDP on average (although falling to 6.1% in 2020 as externally financed projects decline). ",
    "Over 2018-20, tax revenues should increase as a share of GDP, with measures to: (i) expand the tax base by encouraging businesses to formalize, (ii) improve the administration of taxes, (iii) reduce tax exemptions, and (iv) increase some tax rates. Over the same period, expenses are targeted to decline by over 5 percentage points (from 38.7% in 2018) as a result of efforts to (i) streamline non-priority purchases of goods and services, (ii) reduce the wage bill as a share of GDP, and (iii) strengthen public procurement. Modest increases in growth in agriculture and construction, and a solid performance of remittances, are likely to support rural poverty reduction. Social transfers will continue to play an important role in driving poverty reduction in both urban and rural areas. A scheduled increase in pensions should also benefit poor households given that pensions represent close to 15% of income among the poor. The poverty rate is projected to decline to 18.5% in 2018 and 16.7% in 2",
    "020. \n\n###### Risks and challenges \n\n The outlook is subject to downside risks. Growth will continue to be highly dependent on exogenous regional developments. Specifically, a slowdown in Russia and Kazakhstan could affect negatively the baseline scenario via remittances and trade. Adverse exchange rate developments could heighten competition in the domestic and EEU markets. A core challenge continues to be to accelerate the process of convergence of local production to EEU standards. This would help Kyrgyz producers to boost exports of agricultural and textile products in the short and medium run. Another challenge will be to bring fiscal policy back to a sustainable path, while continuing to provide adequate support to the economy. Several policy decisions taken in the run-up to the Presidential elections in October 2017 are expected to add structural pressure on spending, including a universal extension of the previously incometargeted benefit for low income families with children, ",
    "which will complicate the task of fiscal consolidation. \n\n TABLE 2 Kyrgyz Republic / Macro poverty outlook indicators (annual percent change unless indicated otherwise) \n\n 2015 2016 2017 e 2018 f 2019 f 2020 f Real GDP growth, at constant market prices 3.9 3.8 4.5 4.2 4.8 5.0 Private Consumption -0.9 1.8 1.9 2.8 3.6 4.0 Government Consumption 0.9 2.7 0.6 0.6 0.7 0.5 Gross Fixed Capital Investment 3.9 3.7 4.0 4.9 5.7 6.0 Exports, Goods and Services -5.6 2.2 5.6 8.4 8.5 8.9 Imports, Goods and Services -13.2 -4.0 0.0 2.7 3.3 4.4 Real GDP growth, at constant factor prices 3.9 3.8 4.5 4.2 4.8 5.0 Agriculture 6.2 3.0 2.2 2.7 2.2 2.2 Industry 2.9 5.9 10.3 6.8 8.9 9.8 Services 2.6 3.7 4.2 4.3 5.2 5.1 Inflation (Consumer Price Index) 6.5 0.4 3.6 4.0 4.0 4.0 Current Account Balance (% of GDP) -15.8 -12.1 -9.4 -11.0 -10.7 -9.8 Financial and Capital Account (% of GDP) 17.4 9.7 7.2 11.0 10.7 9.8 Net Foreign Direct Investment (% of GDP) 15.1 8.1 6.9 7.0 7.0 6.5 Fiscal Balance (% of GDP) -3.0 -6.6 -5",

    "t in 2017, driven by a fall in investments. The inauguration of the new government in June 2017 resolved the stalemate as evidenced by the companies’ improved expectations on future production. Investment fell by 4.5 percent y-o-y in 2017, but it started recovering by year-end with recovering investor confidence. Private consumption was the only contributor to growth in 2017, supported by higher employment and wages. Netexports contributed negatively to growth (-0.7 pp). Solid exports growth was propelled by the recovery in the Euro area but was not enough to compensate for rising imports for energy, FDI-related imports, and iron and steel. At the sector level, construction and manufacturing stalled in 2017, with construction falling by almost 14 percent y-o-y in real terms as both private and public construction activities stalled. Mining, wholesale and retail trade and agriculture were the only sectors that contributed positively to growth, supported by rising metal prices, growth in",
    " disposable income and a favorable harvest season, respectively. Inflation remained low in 2017 at 1.4 percent, although it increased from a 2016 deflation, driven by rising prices of food and beverages, energy (including oil), clothing and footwear and communications. Despite slower growth, there were improvements in the labor market. Employment \n\n grew by 2.4 percent y-o-y in 2017, helped in part by employment subsidies in the first part of the year, through which almost third of the net new jobs were created. The employment rate has been constantly improving, but remains low at 44 percent, meaning that more than half of the working age population is either unemployed or outside of the labor force. Most of the jobs created were in wholesale and retail trade, accommodation and food services and manufacturing—the latter sectors with links to the FDI-economy, which benefit from tax exemptions and other government support. As a result, the unemployment rate fell to a historical low, at 2",
    "2.4 percent in 2017, close to 80 percent of which is long-term. Poverty is estimated to have continued declining in 2017. Poverty (at US$5.5/day at 2011 PPP) is projected to have fallen to 21 percent in 2017, continuing a decreasing trend present since 2009. Employment growth and increases in salaries, especially in the labor-intensive sectors, are expected to have driven most of the poverty reduction in 2017. Pensions, which played a role in the 2009-2014 decrease, are unlikely to have played a relevant role in recent poverty dynamics. Revenue gains in 2017 were offset by increases in spending, resulting in unchanged fiscal deficit—at 2.7 percent of GDP. Revenues increased on the back of solid VAT and collection of the social security contributions, while expenditures increased due to higher spending for health, pensions, and subsidies. Capital spending once again remained underexecuted reflecting a slowdown in project \n\n#### MACEDONIA \n\n FIGURE 1 Macedonia / Real GDP growth and contr",

Growth is projected to rise to 2.3 percent in 2018, driven by consumption and recovering investment. Despite the slowdown, labor market improved thanks to public subsidies; but employment and labor force participation rates remain low compared to the EU.

Public and publicly guaranteed debt declined to 47.5 percent in 2017, from 48.4 percent in 2",
    "016, but due to a drawdown on accumulated deposits to reduce new borrowing. Credit growth increased in 2017. Household credit grew by 9.2 percent, while corporate lending remained subdued throughout 2017 (2.6 percent). The loan-to \n\n- deposit ratio stood at 88 percent, which should allow banks to expand lending activities. Non-performing loans (NPLs) stood at 6.3 percent, similar to 6.4 percent at end-2016, but corporate NPLs increased slightly to 9.9 percent. The current account deficit narrowed to 1.1 percent of GDP in 2017. Solid export performance of FDIs, iron and steel, furni- ture and tobacco helped to reduce the goods and services deficit to 13.9 percent of GDP (from 15 percent in 2016). Net private transfer inflows increased slightly to 15.8 percent of GDP, while primary income deficit widened further to 4.2 per- cent of GDP as foreign investors kept re- patriating profits amidst the political tur- moil. Foreign direct investments declined in 2017 to only 2.3 percent of GDP, c",
    "om- pared to 3.2 percent in 2016. At end-2017, foreign reserves stood at 4.4 months of \n\n imports and were further replenished in January 2018 as the Government issued a 7 year EUR 500 million Eurobond at 2.75 percent which fully covers government borrowing requirements for 2018. \n\n###### Outlook \n\n The economic outlook is positive, with growth expected to average 2.7 percent during 2018-2020. Construction activity is expected to recover, as the construction of two highways is resumed. The manufacturing sector is also expected to recover, a process that began in late 2017, propelled by improved foreign demand from the EU. Private consumption is projected to rise supported by higher employment and as the new authorities indicated rise in social transfers. Poverty is likely to continue its downward trend in 2018-2020 with improved economic outlook. Public investment in infrastructure should sustain employment creation. Increases in social transfers should also translate into further pove",
    "rty reductions, if properly designed and means-tested. \n\n Fiscal deficit is planned to remain unchanged in 2018 leading to rise in public debt to 50 percent of GDP. \n\n###### Risks and challenges \n\n With the political crisis now resolved, the main risk comes from fiscal vulnerabilities and low potential growth. A low revenue to GDP ratio, a growing deficit in the pension system, higher interest payments, and accumulated arrears are risks to fiscal sustainability. Discussions about raising untargeted social transfers compound the sustainability concerns. Credible fiscal consolidation program focused on strengthening efficiency of public spending and broadening of the tax base would help to stabilize public debt, rebuild fiscal buffers against future shocks and increase investor confidence. Ensuring the backward linkages of the FDIs, unlocking potentials in the energy, tourism and agriculture sectors, as well as reducing the overregulation in professional and infrastructure network servic",
    "es could help increasing the potential growth. \n\n TABLE 2 Macedonia / Macro poverty outlook indicators (annual percent change unless indicated otherwise) \n\n 2015 2016 2017 2018 f 2019 f 2020 f Real GDP growth, at constant market prices 3.9 2.9 0.0 2.3 2.7 3.0 Private Consumption 4.4 3.1 2.9 2.2 1.9 1.9 Government Consumption 3.9 1.9 -1.5 2.1 1.5 1.5 Gross Fixed Capital Investment 2.1 -3.9 -4.5 0.9 3.3 4.7 Exports, Goods and Services 8.5 8.1 9.2 5.4 6.3 6.3 Imports, Goods and Services 9.9 11.6 7.3 3.6 4.2 4.2 Real GDP growth, at constant factor prices 5.0 3.7 -0.8 4.1 2.6 2.9 Agriculture 1.9 2.8 4.1 0.9 1.2 1.2 Industry 6.2 6.1 -7.8 16.4 5.1 5.1 Services 4.9 2.7 1.7 -0.5 1.6 2.1 Inflation (Consumer Price Index) -0.3 -0.2 1.4 1.6 2.0 2.0 Current Account Balance (% of GDP) -1.9 -2.8 -1.1 -2.5 -2.5 -2.6 Financial and Capital Account (% of GDP) 1.8 2.6 1.0 6.7 2.2 2.4 Net Foreign Direct Investment (% of GDP) 2.3 3.3 2.2 2.6 2.9 3.1 Fiscal Balance (% of GDP) -3.6 -2.7 -2.7 -2.7 -2.5 -2.3 Deb",

Despite robust exports supported by the good harvest of the past two years, imports increased rapidly resulting in a negative contribution of net exports to growth (-2.7 percentage points). On the production side, growth has been mainly driven by the retail and wholesale trade (+1.3 percentage points), followed by growth in agriculture (+1 percentage points) and industry (+0.4 percentage points). After a sharp deceleration in 2016, the inflation rate averaged 6.6 percent in 2017, just above the target corridor of 5 percent +/1.5 percent. Increases in regulated prices, unfavorable climatic conditions in Spring which affected seasonal agricultural outputs, and stronger internal demand accelerated the inflation rate, which has been out of the target corridor since April \n\n2017. To stimulate credit activity and ab- sorb the existing liquidity after the bank- ing crisis",
    ", throughout 2017, the NBM grad- ually reduced the base interest rate (from 9 percent to 6.5 percent), while increasing the reserve requirement ratio to a record high of 40 percent. Strong foreign inflows pushed the appreciation of the Moldovan Leu, tempering the cost-push inflation pressures. By end-January 2018, the infla- tion rate registered 6.5 percent y/y. \n\n The increasing real wages and a recovering flow of remittances, as well as the favorable 2016 harvest have been associated with a downward trend in the poverty headcount, which, measured at the international moderate poverty threshold of US$ 5.5/day in 2011 PPP, decreased to 16.3 percent in 2015 from 18.4 in 2014, and continued decreasing in \n\n2016. The unemployment rate fell form 4.9 percent in 2015 to 4.2 percent in 2016, the decline being particularly pro- nounced in rural areas (0.9 percentage points), where the incidence of poverty is higher. Salaries increased by a further 5.2 percent in real terms in 2017, sup- portin",
    "g household welfare. The external position remains stable, de- spite a recent increase in current account deficit. In the first nine months of 2017, exports increased in nominal terms by 25.2 percent, remittances increased by 12.1 percent, while net direct investments in- creased 1.2 percentage points of GDP compared to end-2016, on account of rein- vested profits, reaching 2.5 percent of GDP. Yet, supported by a stronger Leu and imports of electricity, imports in- creased (+22.5 percent y/y), determining the widening of the current account deficit by 3.4 percentage points y/y reaching 9.2 percent of GDP. The current account defi- cit continues to be financed predominant- ly through external debt. As of end- September 2017, total external debt grew by 8.1 percent totaling 83 percent of GDP. Against this background, by end-January 2018 foreign reserves reached an all-time record of 2.9 billion USD, covering more than 5 months of imports. \n\n#### MOLDOVA \n\n FIGURE 1 Moldova / Actual and p",

    "utpaced the double-digit increase in expenditures. Following the under execution in 2016, public spending increased 12.5 percent y/y. Supported by a strong increase in fiscal revenues and better compliance, public revenues increased 16.2 percent y/ y. Buoyant foreign trade was also reflected in strong collections of VAT (+15.8 percent, y/y) and excises (+30.9 percent, y/y). As a result, the fiscal deficit was 2.2 percentage points higher, totaling 0.8 percent of GDP. \n\n###### Outlook \n\n Growth is expected to be robust and reach 3.8% in 2018 and 3.7% in 2019 but remain below the historical averages (of 4.6%). In the medium-term the recovery in remittances together with private wage growth will sustain private consumption, which will remain a key driver of growth. Import growth will outpace export growth, leading to a negative contribution of net trade to GDP growth. With parliamentary elections in November 2018, after a prolonged contraction, the Government \n\n plans to increase public i",
    "nvestments, with a focus on the road sector. Still, structural weaknesses will contain growth at around 3.5 percent. As consumption and imports strengthen, the current account deficit is expected to gradually increase, but to remain below its historical average thanks to revitalization of foreign inflows. The inflation rate is expected to reach the lower bound of the target corridor in 2018 due to base effects and lower regulated prices and to gradually increasing to the target of 5 percent in medium term. In the baseline scenario, fiscal deficits are projected to remain under control. Due to mandated indexation and valorization of pensions, wage increases and additional public capital investments, expenditures will increase reaching about 3 percent of GDP in 2018. The factors underlying a favorable growth forecast similarly suggest a further decline in the poverty headcount during the projection period, following the trend from recent years. Increases in real wages and remittances, as",
    " well as a good harvest year should support household welfare, inclusively in rural areas, where the incidence of poverty remains higher. The rate of wage increases according to latest data from Q3 of 2017 suggests that on an annual basis wages in agriculture increased faster than in the economy overall. The \n\n poverty headcount, measured at the international moderate poverty threshold of $5.5/day is projected to decline from 16.3 percent in 2015 to 12.7 percent in 2018 and 11.7 percent in 2019. \n\n###### Risks and challenges \n\n After two years of good climatic conditions, extreme weather may affect agricultural output with consequences for overall growth. The banking sector has stabilized, yet it is important to continue reforms and strengthen the transparency in the sector. Moreover, the increased demand (+30 percent in the first half of 2017) observed for the unregulated and poorly monitored non \n\n- banking financial intermediation sector raises concerns. Weaker growth of key trade p",

Investment made the strongest contribution to growth at 5 percentage points (pp), as the construction of the Bar-Boljare highway and residential construction accelerated. Consumption also grew, contributing an additional 3.7 percentage points, supported by employment and wage growth. Net exports continued to contribute negatively to growth, but in 2017 subtracted less from growth due to a record tourism season and a pickup in goods exports from the metal industry, driven by improved EU demand. Due to high import content, the growth impact of the higher investment for highway construction is subdued. Credit growth increased by close to 12 percent in 2017, as household len",
    "ding surged, amid subdued corporate lending. NPLs declined to 7 percent of total loans, supported by relaxed voluntary financial restructuring rules. Current account deficit further widened to 18.9 percent of GDP in 2017 on the back of rising constructionrelated imports and despite rise in exports of metals, mineral ore sales, and tourism. Net FDI inflows increased to 11.2 percent of GDP, financing two thirds of the CAD. Still, after a decline in 2016 to 160 percent, external debt increased again in 2017 to an estimated 162 percent of GDP and remains the highest in the region. Robust growth led to employment rise by 2.5 percent in 2017; however, it slowed down in the last quarter by 0.2 percentage \n\n points--first such decline since late 2013, due to agriculture, mining industry, retail and real estate. While the registered unemployment rate increased to above 22 percent in 2017, given the large informality (one out of three jobs), the survey-based unemployment rate shows a decline by ",
    "over 1 pp, to 16.1 percent by September 2017 (a four-quarter average). Surveybased employment rate grew by one percentage point to 45.9 percent along with the activity rate, albeit at a slower pace. Poverty is estimated to have declined in the past few years as economic growth picked up and social transfers surged. In 2017, however, it was difficult to achieve significant poverty reduction given the withdrawal of the mothers’ benefit in the second half of the year. Additionally, led by public sector wage dynamics, real gross wages declined by 0.4 percent in \n\n2017. Poverty (measured as consumption below the standardized middle-income- country poverty line of $5.5/day in 2011 PPP terms) declined from 8.7 percent in 2012 to an estimated 4.4 percent in 2017. Inflation picked up in 2017 to 2.4 percent on the back of rise in excises on tobacco, alcohol and sugary drinks, and spillovers from international oil and food price. Due to the increase in the VAT rate from 19 to 21 percent, and exci",
    "ses on tobacco and alcohol, inflation increased by 2.6 percent yoy in January 2018.

Spending increased by close to 12 percent on the back of tripled capital budget. On the other hand, wage reduction and abolishment of the mothers’ benefit from the second half of 2017 helped decelerate growth of the wage bill and social transfers. Consequently, general government deficit increased from 3.1 percent in 2016 to an estimated 5.2 percent of GDP in \n\n2017.

This has allowed easi- er access to capital market for a regular refinancing of liabilities coming due in 2018 and 2019-2021. \n\n###### Outlook \n\n The economy is expected to grow by an average of 2.5 percent annually in 201820 on the back of public investments and personal consumption. While growth of \n\n investment will s",
    "low down as the highway construction gets to its closure, its contribution to growth will remain strong in 2018. Current imbalances are likely to stay high given the import dependence of the current growth pattern. Inflation is projected at 2.5 percent in the period 2018-19, as the VAT rate rise adds to the current inflation growth in 2018. Fiscal deficit is projected to be brought down to 3.2 percent in 2018, and slowly reaching surplus by 2020. With the potential poverty impact of fiscal consolidation measures, in 2018 poverty is expected to slightly increase as mothers’ benefits phase out. Poverty is likely to resume its decline in 2019-20 to an estimated 4.4 percent by 2020, subject to improvements in private sector employment and earnings. \n\n###### Risks and challenges \n\n The positive economic outlook faces high, but moderating risks. As the highway \n\n construction is completed in 2019, growth will slow unless productivity gains and new private sector investments realize. Large fi",
    "scal deficit and growing public debt call for the decisive implementation of the recently adopted fiscal consolidation program. The fiscal framework that aims to have a balanced budget by 2019, from over 5 percent deficit in 2017, will require credible spending consolidation in wage bill, social transfers, and operational costs to put public deficit and debt on a sustainable trajectory. External imbalances are still high, adding to an already high external vulnerability. Enhancing policy predictability and accelerating the pace of structural reforms, would be needed for their moderation. Reducing unemployment, especially for youth and mitigating short-term poverty and social impacts of fiscal consolidation and facilitating access to employment need to be an important part of the policy agenda. \n\n TABLE 2 Montenegro / Macro poverty outlook indicators (annual percent change unless indicated otherwise) \n\n 2015 2016 2017 e 2018 f 2019 f 2020 f Real GDP growth, at constant market prices 3.4",

Powered by an extremely strong labor market and social spending (mainly for the Family 500+ program), private consumption grew by 4.8 percent, adding 2.8 percentage points to GDP growth. The biggest positive development in 2017 was a 5.4 percent expansion in gross fixed investment. This was a remarkable recovery from a 7.9 percent drop in 2016 caused by a c",
    "yclical fall in EU-funded projects, reduced FDI inflow, and elevated political risk. The rebound in investment resulted from the resumption of EU funding and removal of a source of instability in the banking sector related to the conversion of foreign-currency-denominated mortgages to local currency. The renewed investment helped to boost import demand in the second half of the year. Hence, despite heavy demand for Poland’s exports from outside of the euro zone, net exports contributed just 0.1 percentage points to overall GDP growth. Labor market conditions have tightened further. The ratio of vacancies to unemployment has shot past 10 percent; in four years the number of low-skilled unemployed has been cut in half and now accounts for just 30 percent of unemployment; and, for the first time since the transition, long-term unemployment dipped below 500,000. Employment rates \n\n continued to rise and labor shortages have started to affect business activity. After two years of persistent",
    " deflation, consumer prices rose an average of 2 percent in 2017, mainly because of higher global commodity prices, food inflation and firmer domestic demand. At 2.1 percent year on year in December 2017, inflation is still below the National Bank of Poland (NBP) medium-term target of 2.5 percent. Demand-side price pressures are modest so far, with core inflation just 0.9 percent year on year in December. Real monetary conditions eased considerably in 2017, despite nominal appreciation of the zloty. Since March 2015 the NBP Monetary Policy Council has kept its benchmark policy rate unchanged at 1.5 percent. The zloty continued to be somewhat volatile in 2017 but strengthened overall against the euro and the US dollar. It is estimated that poverty and shared prosperity indicators continued to improve in 2017 in light of surging private consumption supported by a tight labor market and government social programs. Poverty is expected to have declined from 2.7 percent in 2015 to 1.3 percen",
    "t in 2017 using the $5.50/day 2011 PPP poverty line. More efficient tax collection helped the government to realize its ambitious 2017 spending plans while running the tightest budget execution on record. This was possible because more was collected in taxes, mostly from indirect taxes (due to robust private consumption and improved tax compliance) but also from one-off non-tax revenues, such as higher NBP profits.

A recovery in investment in the end of 2017 promises continued growth. The main risks to medium term growth relate to labor shortages and lower allocation of EU funds for Poland. Poverty will continue to decline in line with growing disposable incomes. Although the general deficit is at a record low, structural weakening is possible. Fiscal adju",

    "9. Household spending will benefit from growth in the real wage bill of more than 8 percent in 2018 - 19, plus higher state spending on pensions and social benefits. Rising real incomes are expected to lead to further declines in poverty. The $5.50/ day 2011 PPP pov- erty rate is projected to decline to 1.2 percent in 2018 and further to 1.0 percent by 2020. Public spending is likely to be strong, supported by EU funds and the political \n\n cycle leading up to the elections. High corporate profitability and EU funds should support private investment. Exports and industrial production are likely to benefit from stronger European demand in 2018 19, but imports may outpace both. The general government deficit is set to widen again in 2018 to about 2 percent of GDP—but still safely below the 3 percent EU threshold. Spending is expected to rise due to higher government consumption, local pre-elections investment, and the decision to roll back the planned increases of the retirement age. The ",
    "revenue side will also contribute to the increasing budget gap: non-tax revenues could be lower this year due to less NBP profit, and the change in retirement age will depress social contributions from the cohort eligible for earlier retirement. Public debt will stabilize around 51 percent of GDP in 2018-19, but the structural budget deficit will widen. The current-account is likely to come back to a small deficit in 2018 as robust household consumption, higher investment, and a firming in global commodity markets push up the volume and cost of imports. Nonetheless, the currentaccount deficit will remain modest in 2018 20 at less than 0.5 percent of GDP. \n\n###### Risks and challenges \n\n There are three main clouds on Poland’s economic horizon: (i) Structural weakening in public finance; (ii) a shortage of labor; and (iii) EU sanctions against Poland for not respecting EU democratic values. First, the government's spending plans, with increases in social benefits and public investment, ",
    "and the reduction in the statutory retirement age, could erode the structure of public finances. Strengthening the fiscal position might be difficult given local, presidential, and parliamentary elections all coming up within 18 months. Second, the shortage of labor may soon weigh heavily on GDP growth, and would be exacerbated by retirement of a greater part of the workforce. Too few workers could negatively affect production capacities and investment. This would heighten pressure on the government to encourage immigration, which could come primarily from Ukraine. Third, the government's failure to address rule of law issues and a vote by the European Parliament in late 2017 to initiate Article 7 proceedings against Poland may lead the EU to impose sanctions, possibly lowering the EU fund allocation for 2021 – 27. \n\n TABLE 2 Poland / Macro poverty outlook indicators (annual percent change unless indicated otherwise) \n\n 2015 2016 2017 e 2018 f 2019 f 2020 f Real GDP growth, at constant",

With a 5.4 percent increase, investment also showed signs of recovery. Exports grew strongly (+9.5 percent), but were outpaced by imports (+11.1 percent). O",
    "n the production side, ICT (+10.9 percent) and industry (+8 percent) were the main drivers of growth, with agriculture (+18.3 percent) performing better than expected, facilitated by good weather conditions. Fiscal policy was pro-cyclical in 2017. Increases in public wages and pensions led to a 22 percent hike in the compensation of employees and a 15.5 percent increase in current spending, outpacing fiscal revenue growth (+12.5 percent). The deficit, however, remained below 3 percent of GDP because of the decline in public investment (-9.5 percent), including low utilization of the EU funds. The expansionary fiscal policy led to an overheating of the economy, contributing also to inflation to 4.7 percent in February 2018 – above the upper limit of the National Bank of Romania (NBR) band. In response, the NBR board increased the policy rate by 25 ppts (to 2.25 percent) in two consecutive meetings in early 2018. This came amid robust private sector credit growth (up 5.6 percent as of De",
    "cember 2017) and concerns over the fiscal stance. The current account deficit deteriorated to \n\n 3.4 percent of GDP at end-2017 reflecting the strong imports growth. The labor market benefited from the economic growth, with unemployment falling to 4.6 percent as of December 2017 – a 25 year low – and real wages increasing by 8.1 percent. Nonetheless, the low employment rate of 65.3 in Q3 2017, down 0.2 percentage points from the previous quarter, reflects persistent structural rigidities in the labor market. In line with economic growth, a boost in private consumption and labor market improvements, the poverty rate corresponding to upper middle-income countries (using the $5.50/day 2011 PPP poverty line) is estimated to have declined from 26.1 percent in 2015 to 23.6 percent in 2017, continuing its downward path since the peak of the crisis in 2011 (31.7 percent). High poverty incidence continues to be associated with reliance on agriculture and in rural/marginalized areas. Employment ",
    "gains in sectors that employ a large share of low-skilled people have helped improve the incomes of the bottom 40 and prevented a further increase in the Gini index in 2015. \n\n###### Outlook \n\n The economy is projected to continue to grow above potential in 2018.

Inflation is set to peak at around 5 percent in mid-2018 reflecting the excess domestic demand and the fading out of the base effect of the tax cuts. The NBR anticipates a gradual subsequent decline in inflation towards 3.5 percent at the end of 2018, due to a slowdown in private consumption dynamics as no further fiscal boost to households’ real disposable income is envisioned. The fiscal measures passed in 2017 have put pressure on the consolidated budget deficit. In the absence of corrective measures, the fiscal deficit is projected to reach 3.3 percent of GDP in 2018, which would place Romania on a trajectory to reentering the Excessive Deficit Procedure of the EU. However, the government has stated that, like in 2017, it wou",
    "ld be ready to promote adjustment measures should the deficit threaten the 3 percent ceiling. The widening of the fiscal deficit would push public debt to 46.8 percent of GDP at end-2020, from 44.5 percent in 2017. Despite this, public debt remains one of the lowest in the EU. Strong private consumption aided by the expansionary fiscal policy and continued \n\n growth in real wages, partly supported by minimum wage increases, should boost real incomes and lead to further declines in poverty incidence. Moreover, the planned introduction of the Minimum Social Inclusion Income program (MSII) is expected to improve targeting and increase the level of benefits for the most vulnerable. The $5.50/day 2011 PPP poverty rate is projected to decline to 22.6 percent in 2018, 21.7 percent in 2019, and 20.9 percent in 2020. \n\n###### Risks and challenges \n\n Accumulating fiscal pressures and excess domestic demand limit the space for policy-makers to maneuver in 2018 and beyond. The current account defi",
    "cit is on the rise, and inflationary pressures persist. These developments leave the Romanian economy vulnerable to exogenous shocks. The authorities may need to take corrective measures to keep the deficit below 3 percent of GDP in 2018 through good quality fiscal adjustment. Externally, a \n\n likely tapering of the quantitative easing in the Eurozone and higher global interest rates may lead to a repositioning in investor sentiment towards the emerging economies and to higher refinancing costs, further reinforcing fiscal pressures. On the upside, a better-than-projected economic performance of the Eurozone will act as a driver of growth in the broader EU area, including Romania. Renewed efforts are needed to improve labor participation and generate broad based employment, as unemployment remains high among youth and the low skilled, and to ensure that all Romanians obtain access to high quality public services. Gradually, the focus of the fiscal policy should be rebalanced away from b",
    "oosting consumption towards mobilizing investment, including from the EU funds, to support a sustainable EU convergence path and social inclusion. Reforms in public administration and SOEs, increased regulatory predictability, as well as policies to address the large social and spatial discrepancies should be on the agenda of priorities of the government. \n\n TABLE 2 Romania / Macro poverty outlook indicators (annual percent change unless indicated otherwise) \n\n 2015 2016 2017 e 2018 f 2019 f 2020 f Real GDP growth, at constant market prices 3.9 4.8 7.0 5.1 4.5 4.1 Private Consumption 5.7 7.1 8.8 8.1 7.2 6.6 Government Consumption -0.8 4.8 6.2 5.9 5.4 5.1 Gross Fixed Capital Investment 7.2 0.8 5.4 6.2 5.1 4.8 Exports, Goods and Services 5.3 7.6 9.5 8.3 7.1 7.0 Imports, Goods and Services 9.4 9.7 11.1 9.7 8.4 8.1 Real GDP growth, at constant factor prices 3.6 4.6 7.0 5.1 4.5 4.1 Agriculture -11.1 -0.8 18.3 3.0 2.1 2.0 Industry 6.1 0.4 8.0 6.1 5.2 4.6 Services 4.3 8.1 5.0 4.8 4.4 4.1 Infl",

    "\n\n###### Recent developments \n\n In 2017, Russia’s economy emerged from recession to recovery, with the GDP expanding by 1.5 percent year-on-year. Deepening macro-economic stability, firming energy prices and a recovering global economy contributed to the return to growth. Non-tradable sectors, primarily transportation, retail and wholesale trade, contributed 1.4 percentage points (pp) of the 1.5 percent total. Mineralresource extraction increased by 1.4 percent, year-on-year, as oil production flattened after Russia joined the OPEC+ agreement. Growth in manufacturing was subdued, partly due to lower public spending on defense. Domestic demand was the main engine of growth. Both household and investment demand expanded. Private consumption, supported by growing real wages and pensions and by a revival of credit to households, contributed 1.8 pp to growth. Fixed-capital investment in mineral resource extraction, transportation, and in the financial sector, mainly supported investment gro",
    "wth. However, growth in manufacturing was not followed by fixed capital investment growth. While robust external demand supported the country’s exports, a major increase in imports resulted in a negative contribution of net exports to GDP growth. The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) continued to clean up the banking sector: 16 banks had their licenses revoked due to non-compliance with regulations, and \n\n another systemically important private bank (Promsvyazbank, 1.6 percent share by assets) was bailed out by CBR. That made it the third bank to be rescued under a new resolution mechanism. As a result, the share of state-controlled banks in the combined assets of the Russian banking system has increased to 66.2 percent, most of them under CBR ownership (45 percent of assets). This may affect the level playing-field and pose a conflict of interest between the CBR’s regulatory and ownership functions. In 2017, credit grew both in retail and corporate segments (13.3 percent and 3.8 percent, y",
    "ear-on-year, respectively). The share of non-performing loans remained stable—but high—at 10 percent as of January 1, 2018, and the overall banking sector capital adequacy ratio was also stable at 12.1 percent. However, compared to other emerging markets, both figures point to underlying vulnerabilities in Russia. As of January 1, 2018, profitability in the banking sector declined to 2016 levels, with the return on assets and equity at 1 percent and 8.3 percent, respectively. The CBR continued its gradual approach to monetary easing aimed at anchoring inflation expectations. A combination of a stronger ruble and a bumper harvest, and relatively tight monetary and fiscal policy, helped reach record-low inflation levels. In 2017, consumer inflation reached 3.7 percent (year-on-year, 12-month average), down from 7.1 percent in 2016. In 2017, the current account surplus reached US$40.2 billion, strengthened by an improved trade balance, and was mirrored by higher net capital outflows, \n\n##",

    "xternal-debt repayments. International reserves increased by US$15.4 billion mainly on the back of currency purchases conducted by the CBR on behalf of Ministry of Finance. The general government fiscal stance improved in 2017, aided by higher oil prices, a recovering economy, an improved tax administration, and lower expenditures. The general government primary budget deficit narrowed from 2.8 percent of GDP in 2016 to 0.6 percent of GDP in 2017. Russia’s new fiscal rule, expected to reduce the influence of external volatility on the budget and the real exchange rate, comes into effect in 2019 and will require fiscal consolidation in 2018-20. Combined with the move towards inflation-targeting, it underscores the Russian authorities’ commitment to enhance macro-stability. Unemployment declined further in 2017 to a current 5.2 percent, while real wages and pensions increased on the back of low inflation. Wage growth was highest in the tradable sector and above the rate of inflation in t",
    "he non tradable and public sectors. However, growth in real disposable incomes remained negative, driven by a decline in income from other sources, including some not directly registered by statistics. \n\n The poverty rate under the national definition (population share with income per capita below subsistence minimum level of 9,828 rubles per month in 2016) increased marginally from 13.3 percent in 2015 to 13.4 percent in 2016. The international moderate poverty rate (population share with per capita consumption below 5.5 USD/day in 2011 PPP) increased from 2.7 percent in 2015 to an estimated 3.3 percent in 2016, before decreasing to an estimated 2.9 percent in 2017, as wages and pensions increased. The extreme poverty rate remained marginal, below one percent. \n\n###### Outlook \n\n Amid the recovered oil prices, macro stabilization and improved business and consumer confidence, we expect Russia’s economy to keep growing. With the expected price of oil remaining robust at US$58, 59 and 6",
    "0/bbl in 2018, 2019, and 2020 respectively, our growth estimates stand at 1.7 percent in 2018, 1.8 percent in 2019 and 1.8 percent in 2020. The moderate poverty rate is expected to fall in 2018 and further through 2019. As public spending is constrained, labor income will become the most important \n\n driver of income growth for the bottom 40 percent. Wage growth and pension indexation at the inflation level, will support disposable incomes and contribute to a gradual decline in the poverty rate. However, many households remain close to the poverty line, and many individuals lack formal jobs. \n\n###### Risks and challenges \n\n External downside risks stem from a significant drop in oil prices, a sudden tightening of global financial conditions and an expansion of sanctions. The performance of the banking sector is expected to remain stable. However, the bailout of three large private banks points to the continuing fragility in the sector, and the quality of capital and assets, and related",
    " \n\n- party lending will likely remain a concern. Weak productivity growth and a shrinking labor force will constrain GDP growth. Priority policy objectives include limiting the role of the state in the economy, in- creasing investment, and promoting fair competition. Also, measures to improve the quality of and access to health and education services will be needed to pro- mote longer and more productive work- ing lives. \n\n TABLE 2 Russian Federation / Macro poverty outlook indicators (annual percent change unless indicated otherwise) \n\n 2015 2016 2017 e 2018 f 2019 f 2020 f Real GDP growth, at constant market prices -2.5 -0.2 1.5 1.7 1.8 1.8 Private Consumption -9.4 -2.8 3.4 3.1 2.5 2.5 Government Consumption -3.1 0.9 -0.9 -0.6 -0.5 0.0 Gross Fixed Capital Investment -11.2 0.8 3.6 2.7 2.7 2.7 Exports, Goods and Services 3.7 3.2 5.4 2.0 3.0 3.0 Imports, Goods and Services -25.1 -3.6 17.0 7.0 4.0 4.0 Real GDP growth, at constant factor prices -1.9 0.0 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.8 Agriculture 2.5 2.9",

Based on preliminary assessments from the national authorities, the economy grew by 1.9 percent y/y, compared to previously projected 2.3 percent. Widening external deficit, increase in imports and recovery in consumption are driving a shift from positive to negative contribution of netexports to growth. Looking at sectors of the economy, both services and industry performed well in 2017, growing by 2.2 ",
    "and 3.9 percent (in real terms), respectively. Construction sector started to recover as well (growing at 1.8 percent y/y) on the back of recent improvements in issuing construction permits and lower financing costs as interest rates fell in 2017. On the other hand, agriculture sector output is estimated to have fallen by 9.5 percent (in real terms), compared to 2016, due to the drought. Growth in industry and services contributed to steady labor market performance in 2017, which improved over 2016. The activity rate increased to 54 percent in 2017 (annual average) while the employment rate stood at 46.7 percent (compare to 45.2 percent in 2016), even with unemployment edging up only slightly in the fourth quarter of 2017, to reach 14.7 percent. Average \n\n salaries increased by 3.9 percent in nominal terms in 2017 compared to the year before, mainly driven by growth of wages in the private sector (increase of 4.5 percent). The average pension was 2.4 percent higher than in 2016. Since ",
    "employment and labor income play a strong role in influencing welfare of the poor and vulnerable, poverty (living on income under $5.5/day in 2011PPP terms, the standardized middle-income-country poverty line) is estimated to have declined from 23.8 percent in 2014, to 23.1 percent in 2016, to 22.4 percent in 2017. The increase of salaries and public sector pensions helped household budgets to recover some of the losses from previous fiscal consolidation measures. The energy bill discount program for vulnerable populations was expanded in 2017 to mitigate the impact of increases in electricity tariffs, as part of fiscal reforms. However, a decline in agriculture output in 2017 is likely to have adverse impacts on rural poverty and slow the pace of poverty reduction overall. Also, food prices increased (up by 4.1 percent through December) more than the average CPI, in particular over the summer months, and likely affecting the poor disproportionately. Overall inflation reached 3 percent",
    " by year-end. A good budget performance continued throughout 2017 and Serbia ended up with a surplus of 1.2 percent of GDP in \n\n2017. As a result of lower financing needs, public debt declined to around 62.5 per- cent of GDP year end, compared to 74 percent at the end of 2016.

The current account deficit (CAD) almost doubled (in euro terms) in 2017 (an increase of 94 percent, y/y). This resulted in widening trade deficit, as import increased significantly (14.2 percent, y/y, or around EUR 2 billion), because of a higher import of energy and consumer goods. The growing external deficit continued to be financed by FDI, which increased by 37.5 percent in euro terms. FDI covers 135 percent of CAD. Foreign currency reserves dropped by 243 million euros in 2017. The dinar strengthened by 4 percent against the euro in 2017, while foreign currency reserves decreased by about EUR 245 million through December. The banking sect",
    "or remains stable and loans to the private sector increased by 3.6 percent by end-December (y/y), but mainly due to increase in lending to households (up 7.8 percent, y/y). NPLs declined to 11.1 percent through November, due to more active role of banks in selling and writing off NPLs. Still, NPLs represent a significant problem for state-owned banks. \n\n###### Outlook \n\n In 2018 as well as over the medium term, growth is expected to pick up, thus helping with labor market recovery and poverty reduction. Growth is expected to be driven by increased investment, stimulated by reforms to improve the business climate, and the recovery of consumption (as the fiscal consolidation program gradually expires and private sector wages continue to grow). Growth is expected to be around 3 4 percent over the medium term. With economic growth and improvements in the labor market, poverty is expected to continue its gradual decline. Poverty, measured as income below the standardized $5.5/ day 2011PPP l",
    "ine is estimated to continue declining to around 21 percent by 2019. As part of the government’s fiscal consolidation program, another nominal electricity tariff increase in 2018 will be considered, though smaller than previous increases. The recently expanded energy bill discount program can help protect vulnerable customers, but implementation challenges related to processing of applications remain. \n\n###### Risks and challenges \n\n As witnessed over the last couple of years, Serbian economy is highly vulnerable to climate change related events (droughts, severe winters, floods, etc.). These external shocks might reoccur at any moment in the future thus endangering growth projections. Also, such events often hurt more the poor who predominantly live in areas less protected from climate-related weather events and who depend more on income earned in agriculture. In addition, faster growth requires further effort toward implementation of structural reforms: in secondary and tertiary educ",

Any delay with implantation of these reforms can have a major impact on growth outlook. In addition, the potential distributional impacts of these important structural reforms may present continued challenges to faster poverty reduction in the short run. \n\n TABLE 2 Serbia / Macro poverty outlook indicators (annual percent change unless indicated otherwise) \n\n 2015 2016 2017 e 2018 f 2019 f 2020 f Real GDP growth, at constant market prices 0.8 2.8 1.9 3.0 3.5 4.0 Private Consumption 0.5 1.0 1.7 2.2 2.9 4.0 Government Consumption -1.5 2.3 4.0 3.6 -0.4 11.8 Gross Fixed Capital Investment 5.6 5.1 3.7 5.6 7.7 2.9 Exports, Goods and Services 10.2 12.0 8.1 6.5 7.5 7.5 Imports, Goods and Services 9.3 9.0 7.0 5.9 6.4 7.3 Real GDP growth, at constant factor prices 0.7 3.2 1.4 3.0 3.5 4.0 Agriculture -7.7 8.1 -9.9 5.0 3.0 3",

The economy was largely fueled by private consumption, supported by remittances— which expanded by about 16 percent through nine months of 2017, y-o-y—and by net exports, boosted by metallic minerals. Investments have also fostered growth, despite a deceleration in gross fixed capital formation, reflected both more muted FDI as well as a base effect from past increases. On the supply side, growth was supported by both tradable and non-tradable sectors with the highest contribution by industry followed by agriculture and services. Annual consumer price inflation accelerated to 6.7 percent, slightly above last year’s 6 percent, yet within the National Bank’s target of 7±2 percent.",
    " Inflationary pressures stemmed from the depreciation of the national currency (about 11 percent during the year) which pushed up prices of imported goods along with factors, such as a supply-side shock on some food staples and increases in utility tariffs. As inflationary pressures and expectations moderated, the National Bank lowered the policy rate to 14.75 percent in the beginning of 2018. Preliminary fiscal outcomes for 2017 suggest that the government adhered to the approved medium-term Fiscal Strategy 2017 20. The overall fiscal deficit was reduced to 2.6 percent of GDP in 2017 from 3.9 percent in the previous year (excluding 6.1 percent of GDP related to the financial sector bailout). The authorities spent 13.6 \n\n percent of GDP in investment, while keeping current spending below 18 percent of GDP. The fiscal contraction was attained through cuts of non-priority outlays, delays in implementation of further banking sector bailouts and contained the overall fiscal stance. Constru",
    "ction of the Rogun HPP was on full track, facilitated by proceeds from the Eurobond issuance in late \n\n2017. The latter increased the level of pub- lic debt to above 50 percent of GDP, exac- erbating the country’s debt-related risks. The external position continued to im- prove on the back of the recovering remit- tances, net export growth and more gener- ally improved terms of trade. During the first three quarters of 2017, the current account balance turned positive to 1.5 per- cent of GDP compared to a 4 percent defi- cit in the same period of 2016. Exports grew by over 23 percent bolstered by high- er production of metallic minerals, while imports declined by 3 percent in the first nine months of 2017, y-o-y. Foreign direct investments contracted to 2.1 percent of GDP through January-September 2017 (a historical low), compared to 2.9 percent of GDP in the corresponding period of 2016. The financial sector remains partially in- solvent despite some reduction of non- performing loans",
    " from 47 percent in 2016 to 35.8 percent by end 2017. The two larg- est problem banks have downsized sig- nificantly and now account for about 20 percent of the banking sector.

Despite strong growth, poverty fell only slightly from 30.3 percent in 2016 to 29.7 percent by September 2017 with extreme poverty stagnant at 14.1 percent of population. Income from employment and remittances remain the primary drivers of poverty reduction. Lower remittances slowed the pace of poverty reduction in 2014 – H1 2016, but began recovering in H2 of 2016, and rebounded throughout \n\n2017. Poverty was relatively stagnant in urban areas during 2015-16 (hovering at around 24 percent) but became more dy- namic in 2017 by declining to 22 percent. During the same period rural poverty fell from 36.1 percent in 2014 to 33.1 percent in 2017. Food expenditure accounts for about 75 percent of total consumption for poor households. The Listening-to- Tajikistan survey identified a noticeable decline in the share of households that have reduce",
    "d food consumption to pay for other basic needs – from about 45 per- cent to about 27 percent between Novem- ber 2016 to November 2017. \n\n###### Outlook \n\n Tajikistan’s outlook for the shortto medium term remains positive and is explained \n\n by the improved external environment, including prices projected for major export commodities, and deepening relationship with neighbors, particularly Uzbekistan. Despite the weak banking sector, growth is expected to be around 6 percent supported by growing remittances, construction of large infrastructure projects and electricity sales. Inflation is forecasted to remain in single digits assuming the central bank’s move to the inflation targeting framework improves inflation monitoring. Over the medium term the fiscal stance is expected to remain prudent, in line with the deficit ceiling set by the Government’s medium-term fiscal strategy. The fiscal deficit is projected at around 3 percent of GDP, primarily reflecting investments into infrastruct",
    "ure projects and higher debt service obligations. The baseline scenario does not assume additional budget support for the banking sector resolution; any needed bailout would expand the augmented deficit concomitantly. The external balance is expected to deteriorate, while remaining below 3 percent of GDP affected by second-round effects of the remittance-driven consumption recovery and investment-related imports, particularly for the construction of the Rogun HPP. International reserves, which rose to 5.6 months of imports by the end of September 2017, are expected to decline in \n\n line as the construction of the Rogun HPP unwind into imports. Poverty is projected to fall to about 24 percent by 2020. Strong growth and recovering remittances and expansion of the Targeted Social Assistance (TSA) program nationally are expected to push down poverty over the medium term. \n\n###### Risks and challenges \n\n Risks are tilted to the downside subject to external and domestic factors. External unc",
    "ertainties may negatively affect remittance inflows. Domestic vulnerabilities include the adequate resolution of problem banks, growing contingent liabilities in public enterprises, and a very slow pace of structural reforms, particularly to enhance the business climate. The country’s deteriorated debt trend and growing debt service obligations pose macro-fiscal challenges and limit the fiscal space for much needed social spending. Any potential banking sector bailout and/or secondround of Eurobonds issuance will substantially threaten the country’s fragile macroeconomic stability. \n\n TABLE 2 Tajikistan / Macro poverty outlook indicators (annual percent change unless indicated otherwise) \n\n 2015 2016 2017 e 2018 f 2019 f 2020 f Real GDP growth, at constant market prices 6.0 6.9 7.1 6.1 6.0 6.0 Private Consumption -15.0 6.4 3.3 3.4 3.5 3.5 Government Consumption 3.3 3.9 -5.9 6.8 7.7 8.5 Gross Fixed Capital Investment 24.4 20.3 2.4 3.6 3.8 3.9 Exports, Goods and Services 0.0 0.0 10.4 8.5",

Consumption accounted for over two thirds of growth in this period, and investment starting to pick up. EU recovery helped accelerate exports. Strong demand has come at a cost of growing macroeconomic imbalances. Consumer price inflation averaged 11 percent in 2017. The current account deficit widened from 3.8 percent of GDP in 2016 to 5.5 percent in 2017 amid rising energy prices, high gold demand and imports stimulated by strong growth. A recovery in net portfolio flows helped finance half of the current account deficit while FDI inflows declined. Growth and import demand accelerated revenue collection, keeping the fiscal deficit at 1.9 percent of GDP in 2017. The Central Ban",
    "k raised the effective policy rate from 8.3 to 12.75 percent in 2017 due to price and exchange rate pressures. Despite this, inflationary expectations remain high. Growth in money stock (M3) moderated slightly but remained high at 16 percent in 2017 in line with strong demand, driven by a 20 percent expansion in private sector credit. The Central Bank also introduced stricter regulations on forex debt for corporates to mitigate risks of high forex exposure. Poverty in Turkey continued to decline. The population with per capita expenditure below the poverty line ($5.5 a day in 2011 \n\n PPP) fell from 23.1 percent to a low of 9.9 percent in the 10 years up to 2016. It is estimated to have declined to 9.1 percent in \n\n2017. The more recent progress was helped by the availability of more jobs, coupled with a 30 percent increase in minimum wage in 2016. Strong growth stimulated the labor market in 2017. Unemployment rate decreased by 2.3 percentage points from 12.7 percent in December 2016 t",
    "o 10.4 percent in December \n\n2017. Employment increased by 1.6 million persons in the same period, mainly driven by services (55 percent), industry (19.5 per- cent) and agriculture (18.3 percent). Labor force participation rate for females rose to 33.5 percent, a 1.3 percentage point annual inter-annual increase. Meanwhile, the job- less rate among the youth fell by 4.8 per- centage points to 19.2 percent. \n\n###### Outlook \n\n For 2018, economic growth is projected at 4.7 percent, gradually converging to a potential rate of around 4.55 percent. Recent surveys point to a moderation in consumer demand, weighed down by rising costs and declining real wages. Rapid credit expansion has increased credit risk and raised lending rates, pointing to a slowdown in credit growth in 2018. Nevertheless, expansionary policies will likely in place to stimulate demand to maintain growth especially ahead of the elections.

    "er. In addition, despite banking sector pressures, the Credit Guarantee Fund has been extended by a further TL 55 billion for 2018. Given the above, inflation is expected to remain at just above 10 percent in 2018. Core inflation, which remained elevated, hit double digits in the last months, and could push headline inflation further. The current account deficit is projected to remain high at 5.6 percent of GDP. Despite continued export growth driven by continued recovery in the EU, the import bill is likely to remain large, not least due to rising commodity prices. Poverty is forecast to decrease at a slower pace. It is estimated to decline further to 8.8 percent in 2018 (from 9.1 percent in 2017). Poverty could decline more rapidly if the recently introduced Attraction Centers Program (ACP) proves effective in boosting employment in the poorest regions. The program covers 23 provinces in eastern and southeastern Anatolian regions where poverty rates are 3-4 times higher than in the w",
    "estern regions. It aims \n\n to create new jobs and investments in less developed provinces and reduce high and persistent regional inequality. \n\n###### Risks and challenges \n\n External vulnerability for Turkey remains high. The US monetary policy tightening in 2018 could increase the pace and volume of capital outflows. This increases interest and exchange rate risks for Turkey’s external debt. The private sector is particularly affected as it accounts for 70 percent of external debt. Although most of the debt is of long-term maturity, a weaker Lira and costlier external financing might adversely impact corporates’ balance sheets. This raises macro-financial risks. Capital adequacy and NPL ratios hover around 16 percent and 3 percent respectively, although total troubled assets are estimated to be higher. Exchange rate and interest rate risks, together with a slowing economy, all coming on the heels of rapid credit expansion, point to a potential deterioration in banking sector asset qu",
    "ality. \n\n The US announcement on steel and aluminum tariffs will affect Turkey – the sixth largest seller of steel to the US. The direct impact on the trade balance will likely be limited, given the overall level of trade with the US. The current macroeconomic environment and projected external conditions will require monetary and fiscal discipline. Sound macroeconomic policies need to be accompanied by deeper structural reforms to ensure a more sustainable economic growth trajectory over the medium term. Steady progress in advancing structural reforms will be key to restoring investor confidence, mitigating vulnerabilities, enhancing productivity and supporting growth. On the poverty and inequality front, the impact of the employment subsidies targeted to disadvantaged populations, and the investment incentives focused on lagging regions, remains uncertain, both in the short term and in the long run. In addition, uptake from private employers may not reach significant levels, and lowi",
    "ncome candidates may lack skills for jobs that become available. Considering these constraints, the impact of these policies warrants close monitoring. \n\n TABLE 2 Turkey / Macro poverty outlook indicators (annual percent change unless indicated otherwise) \n\n 2015 2016 2017 e 2018 f 2019 f 2020 f Real GDP growth, at constant market prices 6.1 3.2 7.4 4.7 4.4 4.0 Private Consumption 5.4 3.7 6.1 4.0 3.8 3.6 Government Consumption 3.9 9.5 5.0 5.0 5.3 4.6 Gross Fixed Capital Investment 9.3 2.2 7.3 5.3 4.7 4.0 Exports, Goods and Services 4.3 -1.9 12.0 6.7 5.5 5.0 Imports, Goods and Services 1.7 3.7 10.3 6.0 5.2 4.6 Real GDP growth, at constant factor prices 5.7 3.1 7.8 4.7 4.4 4.0 Agriculture 9.4 -2.6 4.7 1.9 1.9 1.9 Industry 5.0 4.6 9.1 4.0 3.8 3.6 Services 5.6 3.2 7.5 5.4 5.0 4.4 Inflation (Consumer Price Index) 7.7 7.8 11.1 10.4 9.0 8.2 Current Account Balance (% of GDP) -3.7 -3.8 -5.5 -5.7 -5.6 -5.5 Financial and Capital Account (% of GDP) 2.6 2.6 5.5 5.7 5.6 5.5 Net Foreign Direct Inves",

Growth wa",
    "s largely supported by more favorable terms of trade, primarily reflecting a recovery in global gas prices, which rose by 24 percent year-on-year. China remains the largest purchaser of Turkmen gas, while a price dispute with Iran over gas supplies remains unresolved and has affected export revenues. In early 2018, Iran announced readiness to file a case with the International Court of Arbitration. The domestic retail trade sector grew at an annual rate of 19 percent in 2017, as an expansion of credit and government transfers supported consumption growth; the transport and communications sector grew by 11 percent year-on-year, and the service sector grew at an annual rate of 9 percent. However, gross fixed investments fell sharply (by almost 9 percent year-onyear), as flows of both domestic and foreign direct investments fell, dampening growth in the construction sector. Moreover, agriculture output increased by a mere 5 percent, just below GDP growth, suggesting less growth dividends ",
    "for a large share of the population employed in the agricultural sector. Consumer price inflation hiked from 6.2 percent in the end of 2016 to 10.4 percent by the end of 2017. Inflation was driven by the high pressure on the foreign exchange (FX) markets, which pushed up the prices of imported goods, as well as an upward \n\n adjustment of the highly subsidized fuel prices, including for utilities, and a 10 percent rise in public-sector salaries, pensions, and other government payments. The current account deficit remained high in 2017, although with some improvement due to a recovery in global hydrocarbon prices and a substantial contraction in imports. After falling in 2015-16, export revenues grew by 3.6 percent year-on-year in 2017; still not sufficient to close the external gap. In contrast, imports continued to decline, falling by 23 percent in 2017. The sharp drop in imports was due to tighter trade regulations and significant pressures on the FX markets as the authorities avoided",
    " tapping on their buffers, restricting liquidity in the FX markets. The monetary authorities continued to strengthen oversight and control of FX operations, and adopted restrictions that limited foreign currency withdrawals from cash, bank cards, and cross-border transactions in 2017. The drying up of FX liquidity in the domestic markets suggests that a correction of the official exchange rate (currently pegged at 3.5 manat per US dollar) may need to be considered, along with other macroeconomic and structural reforms to reduce the external imbalances. The Turkmen authorities continued their fiscal consolidation efforts and balanced the state budget in 2017, compared to the 1.3 percent deficit in 2016.

Source: Central Bank of Turkmenistan. \n\n Turkmenistan’s real GDP growth rate rose by 6.5 percent year-on-year in 2017, mainly supported by a recovery in hydrocarbon prices. The external and fiscal accounts improved according to official data, but inflation surged to double-digits, hinting at a possible buildup of imbalances. The rise of inflation and the gradual removal of welfare subsidies for utilities has negatively impacted th",
    "e purchasing power of households. The country’s growth outlook remains positive, but risks are tilted downwards, given the needed structural reforms aimed at boosting privatesector development. \n\n 9.2 \n\n 14.7 \n\n 11.1 10.2 10.3 \n\n6.5 (^) 6.2 6.5 -50 -40 -30 -20 -10 0 10 20 30 40 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Real GDP growth (LHS) Change in gas prices (RHS) Percent Percent 0 20 40 60 80 100 2.6 120 2.8 3.0 3.2 3.4 3.6 3.8 4.0 4.2 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Exchange rate, TMT/US$ (LHS) Oil prices, average (RHS) USD/TMT (^) US$ per barrel \n\n\n94 ● World Bank ECA Economic Update May 2018 \n\n MPO 81 Apr 18 \n\n2017. Reportedly, civil servant wages, pensions, and other core social transfers were protected. It should be noted that the state budget does not represent the full fiscal picture as an important share of public spending is executed via extra- budgetary funds, including through di- rected lending. Turkmenistan does not release official statis- ",
    "tics on household welfare, and little is known about most recent labor market de- velopments. However, the gradual removal of subsidies for utilities and rising inflation is likely to have affected the real purchasing power and living standards of households. \n\n###### Outlook \n\n The baseline scenario assumes a continuation of fiscal consolidation, some moderation in the buildup of external imbalances, and (sustainable) external debt accumulation to help finance the still sizeable (but narrowing) current account deficit. This baseline, however, is not without downside risks. Turkmenistan’s outlook will remain highly dependent on hydrocarbon prices and the growth performance of its major trading partner, China. Over the medium term, the real GDP growth rate is projected to remain below 7 percent, assuming favorable tailwinds (including via the \n\n terms of trade) but slow progress on implementing the national strategy’s structural reforms aimed at promoting nontraditional (non-hydrocarbon",
    ") exports. Inflation would remain high while gradually returning to single digits, assuming further fiscal and monetary tightening. The positive outlook on gas prices and the robust external demand from China would help strengthen the external position. The current-account deficit would narrow from its peak level in 2016, largely on the back of the restrain on merchandise imports due to FX constraints. Over the medium term, the reduction on imports would also follow in case the construction of the Turkmenistan—Afghanistan—Pakistan—India (TAPI) gas pipeline project is delayed. More generally, however, a sharp reduction of imports driven by FX restrictions could impinge on domestic price dynamics, and/or curtail the government’s ability to proceed with ongoing investment projects, harming the growth prospects. \n\n###### Risks and challenges \n\n There are both external and domestic threats that raise country’s risk profile. External risks include weaker-thanexpected growth in trading partne",
    "rs, particularly in China, and an unexpected \n\n drop in energy prices, which may exacerbate external and domestic imbalances. Domestic risks include a low quality and rapid credit expansion that may potentially undermine the performance of the financial sector, lower-than-expected returns on state-funded projects, and the stalling of structural reforms aimed at diversifying the economy through privatesector development. An opening of the economy, an improvement in the business regulatory environment, an acceleration in the corporatization and privatization of state-owned enterprises, and more investments in human capital will be vital to boost private-sector development and achieve the goals of the mediumand long-term national development strategies. Limited access to economic opportunities, and lack of economic diversification remain a major obstacle to inclusive growth, especially for households outside the capital city Ashgabat. Households in rural areas are more vulnerable to econo",
    "mic downturns and the rising inflation, due to factors that include their limited access to jobs beyond the agricultural sector. Economic diversification (beyond the gas and agricultural sectors) with further private sector growth would create more economic opportunities for households, including those in rural areas and secondary cities. \n\n TABLE 2 Turkmenistan / Macro poverty outlook indicators (annual percent change unless indicated otherwise) \n\n 2014 2015 2016 2017 e 2018 f Real GDP growth, at constant market prices 10.3 6.5 6.2 6.5 6.3 Inflation: consumer price index, end of period 4.4 6.0 6.2 10.4 6.2 Current account balance (% of GDP) -6.4 -14.1 -21.0 -11.6 -11.5 of which: Exports of hydrocarbons (% of GDP) 42.0 29.9 16.6 14.7 14.4 Financial and capital account (% of GDP) 7.0 5.2 9.8 6.8 7.7 of which: Net foreign direct investment (% of GDP) 8.8 8.6 6.1 4.5 3.6 Fiscal balance (% of GDP) 0.9 -0.7 -1.3 -0.2 0.5 Public debt (% of GDP) 18.0 19.4 23.9 24.3 27.6 \n\n Sources: World Bank",

GDP grew by 2.5 percent in 2017 (and 2.3 percent in 2016) which is a weak recovery since it follows a cumulative 16 percent contraction in 2014-2015. Key sectors exhibiting relative strength such as manufacturing and domestic trade grew over 5 percent in 2017, while construction grew by almost 27 percent. In contrast, mining and electricity generation contracted due to the trade blockade with Donbas. The growth of fixed investment has slowed in the second half of the year, while FDI remained weak at 2.1 percent of GDP in 2017, compared to 5 percent on average before the crises. Investor confidence has been affected by the slow pace in adopting key reforms and delays in completing reviews of the IMF program given macroeconomic vulnerabilities and uncerta",
    "inty surrounding the 2019 elections. CPI reached 13.7 percent at the end of 2017, that is significantly higher than the NBU target of 8+/-2 percent, due to growth of public sector wages and pensions. As a result, NBU raised its key policy rate to 17 percent in March 2018 from 12.5 percent in April 2017. This has increased the cost of funds for local currency borrowing for both the government and the private sector. Poverty remains above pre-crisis levels, but has registered small decline I in 2017 due to the modest economic recovery and wage growth. The unemployment rate \n\n remained steady in the third quarter of 2017 at 9.4 percent, compared to 9.2 the previous year. Real wages grew significantly by 19 percent in 2017 in part due to higher public-sector wages. This, together with real growth of pensions, led to further decline in poverty (consumption per capita below 5.5 USD/day in 2011 PPP) to 5.7 percent in 2017 from 6.4 percent in 2016 and 7.8 percent in 2015. Estimates of poverty ",
    "by the National Statistical Service using an absolute poverty line comparable over time show much higher incidence levels, but a similar modest decline to 51.1 percent in 2016 from 51.9 percent in 2015. The fiscal deficit was within target in 2017 but spending growth, inflation, and the current account deficit remain high. The fiscal deficit remained flat and on target at 2.4 percent of GDP in 2017. However, expenditures were up by 11.7 percent in real terms and reached 42.6 percent of GDP due to the increase in the minimum wage (resulting in higher wages for teachers, doctors, and civil servants), as well as higher spending on social programs. This was balanced by strong revenue growth in 2017, driven by payroll tax (20 percent in real terms, due to the hike in wages), VAT (17 percent, due to higher proceeds from imports) and personal income tax (16 percent). Public and publicly guaranteed debt level remained high at 70.4 percent of GDP in 2017. The boost in wages and social expenditu",
    "res triggered inflationary and current account pressures in 2017. The current account deficit was at 3.5 percent of GDP in 2017. FDI remains weak and covered 60 percent of the CAD, with the remainder financed by public and \n\n#### UKRAINE \n\n FIGURE 1 Ukraine / Real GDP growth and contributions to real GDP growth \n\n FIGURE 2 Ukraine / Actual and projected poverty rates and real private consumption per capita \n\n Sources: State Statistic Service of Ukraine.

International reserves grew to $18.8 billion or an equivalent of 3.4 month of imports. \n\n###### Outlook \n\n Bolstering economic growth and addressing macroeconomic vulnerabilities will require progress on the unfinished structural reform agenda. Progress on the reform agenda and staying on track with the IMF program would not only boost potential growth, but also provide an important signal to strengthen investor confidence. This would help stimulate a sustained recovery in fixed investment, financed by local sources and FDI, and boost growth to 4.0 percent by 2019. With agriculture and commodities expected to remain relatively flat in 2018, the acceleration in growth is expected to come from manufacturing, construction, and services. Meeting the fiscal deficit target of 2.5 percent of GDP will require better targeting of social programs, rationalizing public sector staff",
    "ing, and implementation of the recently adopted education and health reform laws in a manner that \n\n leads to optimizing the school and hospital network. Under an alternative scenario where reforms do not progress and the IMF reviews are not completed, growth is likely to remain at 2 percent, or potentially fall further if political and social stability deteriorates around the 2019 elections. The moderate poverty rate (under 5.5 USD/ day) is expected to decline further in 2018 but remain elevated through 2019. As public spending is constrained, labor income will become the most important driver of increasing incomes for the bottom 40 percent. Some rebound in the real sector, including wage growth in the private sector will support disposable incomes and help the poverty rate to gradually decline. However, the magnitude of this reduction will depend on the growth prospects, especially in the sectors were most of the poor/ vulnerable are employed (trade, manufacturing, agriculture, const",
    "ruction). \n\n###### Risks and challenges \n\n Elections scheduled in 2019 pose major risks in adopting further reforms needed to mobilize international financing, address \n\n fiscal and financial sector imbalances, and promote stronger economic growth. Macroeconomic vulnerabilities come total fiscal financing needs of $18 billion in 2018 and 2019 that will require mobilizing about $8 billion in external financing. Additional fiscal pressures come from the rising public-sector wage bill and significant spending on social programs, which will prove challenging to consolidate through the 2019 elections. Financial sector weaknesses from high nonperforming loans at 55% of total loans, weak corporate governance of the dominant state-owned banks, and weak financial position of the Deposit Guaranty Fund not only stand in the way of stimulating investment and growth, but also pose significant fiscal risks. With real household incomes still below pre-crisis levels, continued weak economic growth of ",
    "2 percent going into the 2019 elections could undermine overall political and social support for the broad reform effort launched since 2014. External risks related to possible decline in commodity prices and higher inflation in advanced economies that may result in higher external trade deficit and cost of financing respectively. \n\n TABLE 2 Ukraine / Macro poverty outlook indicators (annual percent change unless indicated otherwise) \n\n 2015 2016 2017 2018 f 2019 f 2020 f Real GDP growth, at constant market prices -9.8 2.3 2.5 3.5 4.0 4.0 Private Consumption -19.7 1.8 7.8 5.4 4.1 3.8 Government Consumption -0.4 0.0 3.3 4.5 3.2 1.6 Gross Fixed Capital Investment -9.2 20.1 18.2 14.9 9.0 9.2 Exports, Goods and Services -13.2 -1.6 3.5 8.0 6.4 5.9 Imports, Goods and Services -17.9 8.4 12.2 14.0 7.2 5.8 Real GDP growth, at constant factor prices -8.8 2.4 2.5 3.5 4.0 4.0 Agriculture -4.4 6.0 -2.5 0.5 2.0 2.5 Industry -15.1 3.3 2.5 5.0 4.5 4.0 Services -7.3 1.4 3.4 3.6 3.6 4.2 Inflation (Consu",

Total investment moderated relative to previous years, while remaining the main growth engine for the economy. This was possible thanks to the public investment program, which supported a range of sectors (transport, utilities, oil and gas explorations, and housing) as well as public enterprises and private investment activity. On the other hand, private consumption declined slightly in real terms due to the pickup in CPI inflation, and despite a recovery in remittance inflows (which rose by 27 percent y/y in dollar terms in the first 9 months of 2017, together with the strengthening of economic activity in Russia). The average nominal monetary income of the population grew by 12.3 percent in 2017, supported by an increase in minimum s",
    "alaries and pensions by 15 percent in December 2017 (vis-à-vis an average inflation of 12.5 percent in 2017, in line with the IMF’s methodology). Higher food inflation negatively affected mostly urban consumers, particularly among the bottom 40 percent households for whom food accounts for 61 percent of total consumption. Uzbekistan mitigated the impact of export price declines in 2014 16 via increased export volumes. This trend continued in the first half of 2017 —albeit at a decelerating rate as capacity diminished. Imports \n\n also grew, however, on the back of lower import prices and the very significant reduction in import tariffs implemented in September, which resulted in an expanded demand for imported goods. The trade balance was in surplus in 2017 (compared to a deficit in 2016) thanks to the higher commodity prices in the second half of 2017, and the recovery of food and manufacturing exports as the demand of Uzbekistan’s trading partners firmed up. Overall, the current accou",
    "nt surplus strengthened further in 2017 compared to 2016, owing not only to the stronger trade balance, but the recovery remittances. On September 5, 2017, the Central Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU) liberalized the exchange rate; the official rate depreciated from 4,210 UZS to 8,100 UZS per dollar, as it converged with the curb rate; the CBU has pursued a managed floating of the currency thereafter. The authorities also abolished the mandatory sales of a portion of firms’ export revenues to the CBU at the official exchange rate (“surrender requirements”), widening the participation of the private sector in the foreign exchange market. In preparation of the exchange rate liberalization, the CBU raised the policy rate from 9 to 14 percent in June 2017, curtailing the strong credit expansion that took place earlier in the year, and helping stabilize the banking-loans-toGDP ratio at 43.1 percent in 2017 (compared to 26.6 in 2016). Official figures suggest that non-performing loans (NPLs) were at",
    " 0.79 percent in Q2 2017 and 1.2 percent at the end of 2017 as per CBU estimates; Moody’s assessed NPLs at 2.0-2.5 percent in August 2017; these could be \n\n#### UZBEKISTAN \n\n FIGURE 1 Uzbekistan / Real GDP growth and contributions to real GDP growth \n\n FIGURE 2 Uzbekistan / Poverty, GDP per capita, and small business development \n\n Source: Uzbekistan official statistics.

    "orrowers, particularly public enterprises. During 2017 the government sustained a robust (but softer) public investment program, while cutting back on current spending to meet its state budget targets. The authorities reduced direct taxes on firms and citizens while increasing property and resource taxes in an effort to achieve revenue neutrality while supporting economic activity. The government launched a privatization program and sold 542 state objects in 2017 with budget receipts of 0.3 percent of total budget revenue. The government also drew from its significant fiscal buffers (at the Uzbek Fund for Reconstruction and Development, UFRD, a reserve fund) to cover the debts of largest bank and industry public enterprises (particularly in the energy sector) that were affected by the depreciation of the official exchange rate. As a result, the augmented budget (including the state and UFRD activity) incurred a larger deficit of 3.3 percent of GDP in 2017, relative to a 0.6 percent of ",
    "GDP a year earlier. The official poverty rate declined slightly from 12.5 percent in 2016 to an estimated 12.4 percent in 2017. Still robust economic growth, small business development, and social safety net programs have driven \n\n poverty reduction in the past. Income distribution has become more equitable over time and the official Gini coefficient fell from 0.39 in 2001 to 0.29 in 2013. However, the official unemployment rate was 5.8 percent in 2017, higher than 5.2 percent in 2016. \n\n###### Outlook \n\n Robust growth is expected to continue at about 5 percent in 2018-19, but job creation may take longer to pick up, as investments may not return quickly to pre2017 levels. Fiscal activity (including through UFRD lending) and bank credit are projected to become less expansionary than in the past to help reign on inflation, which is expected to remain elevated as liberalized prices continue to adjust. Budget spending would be geared towards mitigating the impact of the exchange rate adju",
    "stment on the vulnerable population, as well as supporting critical public enterprises to gradually converge towards greater sustainability and cost-recovery, and sustaining the public investment program. Monetary policy is expected to be tighter than in previous years, also aiming at containing inflation from trending up. \n\n The current account surplus would narrow as imports continue to rise in the face of trade liberalization, even as exports (both commodities and manufactures) maintain a positive growth, and remittances remain solid. Real GDP growth is projected to accelerate slowly to 5.5 percent by 2020 as the private business climate improves on the back of the reform process, supporting an acceleration of private investment, including FDI. While data limitations do not allow for poverty projections, we expect that increased income growth and the sustained robust net remittances in 2018 will allow some progress in poverty reduction over the near term. \n\n###### Risks and challeng",
    "es \n\n Uzbekistan economy’ upside and downside risks are broadly balanced. On the upside, there are benign prospects for commodity prices, and accelerated private investment (including as FDI) thanks to the authorities’ bold reform agenda. On the downside, a slower recovery in the Russia’s economy, potential delays in other structural reforms and higher inflation could undermine growth and job prospects. \n\n TABLE 2 Uzbekistan / Macro poverty outlook indicators (annual percent change unless indicated otherwise) \n\n 2015 2016 2017 e 2018 f 2019 f 2020 f Real GDP growth, at constant market prices 7.9 7.8 5.3 5.0 5.1 5.5 Private Consumption 1.1 1.0 -0.3 1.2 1.2 2.2 Government Consumption 7.2 -12.8 -8.3 -7.6 -4.3 -1.1 Gross Fixed Capital Investment 9.5 9.5 7.1 6.9 7.0 7.5 Exports, Goods and Services 5.6 11.6 13.9 18.5 17.4 16.0 Imports, Goods and Services -2.1 -3.6 7.1 16.4 16.9 17.2 Real GDP growth, at constant factor prices 7.8 7.9 5.3 5.0 5.1 5.5 Agriculture 6.8 6.6 2.0 3.6 3.7 4.4 Industr",

    " with challenges around regulation, data safety and privacy, as well as governance and bureaucracy to name just a few. As Web3 gains more traction globally it activates new paradigms to engage, govern, create, iterate, and implement around research results in ways that were previously complex and arduous. The Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO) is one such empowering Web3 utility, and within this framework researchers and experts have the opportunity to implement and test their research results promptly on a small or large scale as required. In this paper, we provide an overview of Web3 technologies and their implications for education and research.

INTRODUCTION We are at the beginning of a new online era the Web3 era. With its foundational technology, the Blockchain, Web3 has the power to change people's lives the way",
    " the Internet has over the last twenty years [1]. Blockchain is a disruptive technology that provides a decentralized solution for communication and transactions [ 2 ]. The decentralized nature of blockchain technology provides a foundation for profound systemic changes in society. In general, a centralized platform relies on a controlled database as a foundation to provide value to its users, which requires the trustworthiness of a third-party service provider. Many of the Internet applications (e.g., email and the Domain Name System) remain largely centralized in terms of their management and core development. This centralization brings with it issues with transparency, data integrity, data privacy and security, with clear correlations with the current multi-faceted embedded centrality of internet from client-server communication structure to the Public Clouds and Cloud based systems [ 2 ]. Similarly, the issue of trust in cloudhosted data storage is another challenge of the centrali",
    "zed nature of the Internet, in the need for verifying that the cloud is not corrupting the data stored by customers [1]. In contrast, decentralization means that the database does not depend on a particular organization or administrator but is distributed among all peers [ 3 ]. Such technological advancement could bring positive change to systems facing trust issues (e.g., finance, politics, or any data collection system). Blockchain, with its premise of immutability, transparency, and peer-to-peer consensus as well as benefits of transparency, accountability, integrity, scalability, security and privacy can provide the means for trustworthy auditing of networked systems while returning much of the control to the edges of a network [ 2 3 ]. Today, Web3 is an early embodiment of blockchain's acceleration of technological change, which is already having a profound impact on society and the economy. The potential impact of Web3 technologies (e.g., blockchain) is endless in transforming fi",
    "nance (DeFi), law (data privacy), research (data sharing), as well as new forms of ownership (NFTs) and, more recently, research and education (k12crypto, k20educators) Central to this theme is an understanding of a DAO framework. DAOs are decentralized, autonomous organizations governed by a community and smart contracts (as seen in Figure 1) [16]. They enable people to coordinate and govern themselves through self-enforcing rules encoded in a software infrastructure on a public blockchain [ 4 ]. The community-centric nature of DAOs makes them potentially fertile ground for testing hypotheses and extending research findings to more practical insights. Beyond that, they are enabling a new research methodology based on transparency, data privacy, and ease of data sharing. Figure 1. The structure of DAO [16] \n\n\nThe goal of this paper is to provide an overview of Web3 technologies, their benefits, and risks, and to explore the impact of Web3, particularly the DAO framework, on the researc",
    "h community and the education sector. II. WEB 3 OVERVIEW _A. Online evolution: from Web1 through Web 2 to Web3_ A basic understanding of the concept of Web3 can be gained through comparison to its Web1 and Web2 predecessors, as shown in Table I. The hallmark of Web1 was \"read-only\", meaning that only technology enthusiasts and technology companies could create the content that users then consumed. Communication was created with Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) which was the hallmark for establishing static web pages as content on the Web [ 2 ]_._ Relative to today, only a small amount of content was created, and the majority of users were content consumers. But some of the problems of Web1 included its slowness and the constant need for site updates every time new information reached web pages; and the fact that it was not possible to use the power of network effects, relying only on a few authors and a large number of readers [ 5 ]. It was the crash of the dotcom bubble in 2000 whic",
    "h led to the next iteration of the Internet. Web2 introduced the \"read-write Web\" also referred to as the participatory social Web allowing users to create shared content by utilizing server-side scripting to allow online services and proliferate [ 2 ]_._ With Web2 we saw the rise in popularity of centralized social platforms and global websites emphasizing user-generated content (UGC) and usability for end users. Web2 was the next generation of network services and transformed the world wide web network into a platform by supporting content sharing through applications such as wiki, web blogs, etc. [ 5 ]. Some of the problems of Web2 were in its security (easy to hack e.g., Cross Site Request Forgery, Cross Site Scripting, Information Leakage etc.) and its centralized nature [ 5 ]. This leads us to the Web3 \"read-write-own\" version of the Internet, where user data is no longer owned by centralized platforms and users can more easily move their data assets between platforms, allowing d",
    "ifferent services to display different views for the same assets or data. Web3 tools provide interoperability that is immutable and trustless, enabling powerful new applications for every corner of society. Yahoo founder Jerry Yang said of Web3, _\"...you don't have to be a computer scientist to create a program. We are seeing that manifest in Web2, and Web3 will be a great extension of that, a true communal medium... the distinction between professional, semi-professional and consumers will get blurred, creating a network effect of business and applications\"_ [ 5 ]. And that's what we are witnessing right now both technical and non-technical people building the new Internet. _B. What are Web3 technologies and applications?_ To ensure the quality of the content of this article, we start with a clear explanation of a few important concepts: “Blockchain”, \"DAOs\", and \"Smart Contracts\". The goal of the Web3 movement is for decentralised and democratised control of the Internet, rather than",
    " control being in the hands of an oligarchic group of interdependent multinational corporations [ 6 ]. In other words, one of the aims of Web3 is to provide solutions to data security and privacy problems in the 21st century by negating the roles of corporations that have established themselves as the trusted intermediaries. This is possible due to blockchains that allow the Internet to achieve a distributed state of the network by allowing ‘trust’ to be shared across the connecting networks. This ‘trust’ gives the notion of web of trusts between nodes in the Blockchain [ 2 ]_._ Blockchain is described as a database that is used as storage for a decentralized network [ 2 ]. It can also be described as a decentralized and immutable database that facilitates its chain network with its participating nodes through a voting scheme [ 2 ]. One of the applications of Web3 that provides the framework for the above is “DAO” a blockchain-based system whose governance is decentralised, that is, in",
    "dependent from central control [ 10 ]. DAOs can also be viewed as participatory governance structures for selfmanagement of digital resources, where rules are mediated by software code. As such, they are a promising digital governance infrastructure for people to operationalize data trust principles [ 7 ]. Currently, DAOs are still a highly experimental governance model, as both the tools and the science behind them are still evolving through the research and development of different DAO communities. They are heterogeneous and appear in many forms with different goals, from shared investment vehicles like FlamingoDAO to community platforms for building and funding the Open Web like GitcoinDAO. DAOs vary widely in their legal structure, from registered legal entities in which only accredited investors can participate to completely unregistered open-source software organisations. Varying goals mean that some DAOs are optimised for a variety of objectives, including financial gain, ideolo",
    "gically motivated efforts at TABLE I. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN WEB1 – WEB3 **Web1 Web2 Web3** Mostly Read-Only Wildly Read-Write Portable and Personal Company focus Community Focus Individual Focus Owning Content Sharing Content Consolidating Content Web Forms Web Applications Smart Applications Directories Tagging User Behaviour Page Views Cost Per Click User Engagement Low data richness (HTML/Portals) Medium data richness (XML/RSS) High data richness (RDF/RDFS/OWL) \n\n\ndecentralised software development, social engagement, or more complex social purposes [ 7 ]. As an example, to design DAOs as data trusts, there is a need for a clear purpose, an infrastructure of smart contracts and tokens, clear rights, and duties over the data, clearly defined decision-making processes, an articulation of how benefits are shared, and a token economics model for sustainable funding [ 7 ]. In this structure, digital tokens are leveraged as value to align incentives (rewards); as payment to fund the operati",
    "ons of the DAO; or as staked collateral which risks penalty upon misbehaviour to enforce good behaviour in the system [ 4 ]. The most important aspect of DAOs is that they are collectively owned and managed by their members (through the ownership of digital tokens). By using smart contracts, a DAO can easily enforce its own rules, policies, and functionalities but they are only as good as their underlying smart contract. In simple terms, smart contracts are code that is installed on and executed by a blockchain. They have a unique address where they store code, data, and a balance that provides them value [ 8 ]. As visible in Figure 2 [16], Smart contracts are the backbone of any DAO, ensuring that automated processes run according to predefined rules the rules that are written into the code, where they are transparent, verifiable, and enforceable. _C. Web3: Challenges and steps towards building solutions_ As with all new technologies, Web3 brings important challenges to be aware of, p",
    "rovided here with some examples of the tools and systems being developed to solve them. _1) Perceived high barriers to entry:_ similar to the early days of the Internet, one of the current problems of Web3 is the public perception of applications of these technologies as \"scams\" particularly noticeable in the areas of crypto-coins and digital non-fungible-tokens (NFTs). To participate, the current requirements do require some technical understanding, and these perceived complexities create barriers to entry, so mainstream consumers are resistant to many of these ideas. To address this problem, there are many Web3 projects that are educating the general public about the technologies behind Web3. One of the biggest projects is \"Rabbit Hole\" a learn-to-earn platform where individuals earn tokens while learning how to use and contribute to decentralised applications. Another example is \"BuildSpace\" a project-based learning program for developers, where they can learn Solidity (a programmin",
    "g language designed for developing smart contracts that run on Ethereum), and how to create NFT and/or DAO projects. In addition, there are many “no-code” tools that allow non-technical people to quickly build and work in the Web3 space. The best known are: 1) Aragon a platform that allows any participant to collaborate with others without involving a third-party organization by creating a DAO; 2 ) Colony an infrastructure that enables organizations to collaborate with each other through decentralized software implemented on Ethereum; 3) DAOstack an open source, modular DAO project which leverages the technology and adoption of decentralized governance and allows people to create dApps (decentralized applications), DAOs, and DAO tools [1]. _2) Energy consumption:_ On the technical side, the current consensus mechanics for establishing the trustworthiness of blocks, called \"proof-of-work,\" is not only complex to understand, but can also consume a nontrivial amount of energy. \"Proof-of-w",
    "ork\" (PoW) requires network validators to solve a mathematical puzzle to become the entity responsible for validating the last block, consuming a large amount of energy in the process [ 9 ]. The complexity of the calcuation is determined by the overall computation power of the Blockchain, and the length of the chain is proportial to the amount of workload [ 2 ]. PoW has its foundations from cryptocurrenctis like Bitcoin and Ethereum. If Bitcoin were a country, it would be one of the top 30 energy consumers in the world [ 9 ]. To move this in a \"greener\" direction, developers are steadily rolling out implementations of proof-of-stake models that consume less energy than proof-of-work because it does not require computing power to solve a mathematical problem, but instead awards the right to validate transactions to different validators depending on the percentage of tokens locked by each validator [ 9 ]. _3) Legal aspects:_ Another point that shows both how early the implementations of ",
    "these technologies are, and their risk, is the fact that there are little to no regulations or laws that specify what can be published or used. Currently, the state of Wyoming is the only US state that has approved a DAO with having legal status, whilst El Salvador is one of the earliest nation-state adopters of cryptocurrency, having introduced bitcoin as the country’s legal tender in September 2021. A 2021 research study [ 7 ] notes that the “autonomous” nature of a DAO is incompatible with the notion of legal personhood, as legal personhood can only be established if there is one or more identified actors responsible for the actions of a particular entity. For DAOs however, this might not necessarily be the case. The discussion on whether a DAO should be identified and recognized as a legal person has important implications in the legal field, as it can determine the extent to which a DAO can be considered a separate legal Figure 2. Steps to launch a DAO project [1 6 ] \n\n\nentity fro",
    "m its human actors, and thus the extent to which these actors can be shielded from the liabilities of the DAO [ 7 ]. _4) Security threats:_ In 2016 the first ever instance of a DAO resulted in a well-publicised scandal “The DAO” taught the world about the potential of getting hacked. The DAO project was the largest crowdfunding project in history with 11,000 members and 150 million dollars raised [1]. The project was an overnight success until a hacker took advantage of a well-intentioned but poorly implemented DAO feature designed to prevent the majority from tyrannising over dissenting DAO token holders [ 3 ]. This made The DAO vulnerable and in return the attacker was able to steal about $50 million dollars’ worth of ETH (cryptocurrency) [ 3 ]. The outcome resulted in a “hard fork” in the Ethereum blockchain and an expensive list of risk mitigating procedural best-practices [ 3 ]. One potential solution could be in endowing the curators with limited decision authority, something equ",
    "ivalent to a “pause” button on transaction [1 4 ]. For this to happen, the governance model should change. _5) Engagement:_ As for the challenges within DAOs, one of the current biggest one is related to the engagement’s numbers existing research shows that less than 10% of members vote on proposals [ 10 ]. In addition to that, procedures are slow, as consensus is required for certain actions. Regardless, these first organisations can be seen as guinea pigs that are experimenting with a novel system for the first time thus still finding and building a way towards a higher engagement [ 10 ]. III. WEB 3 IN SCIENCE _A. Web3: potential of improving research field_ For more than 300 years, scientific publications have served as cornerstones of scientific knowledge, linked by citations. This model has continued, with only minor interruptions, over the past several decades into today's digital age of Web3. As we now move toward a future in which the peer-to-peer Web3 is increasingly disruptiv",
    "e and entire industries are rapidly changing, it is highly likely if not inevitable that the implementation of Web3 technologies will continue to improve the research field. In the last decade, technological innovations have led research consortia to use data-driven approaches and make smart decisions together to improve research activities [ 8 ]. One of these is data sharing, which has the potential to maximize knowledge gains from research efforts in multiple domains. Previously widely used privacy and data sharing tools were often criticized for problems with centrality. In recent years, distributed ledgers and blockchain technology have shown promise in supporting immutable and trusted data sets in a variety of use cases. The use of blockchain technologies in data collection and sharing ensures that participants have the ability to obtain, own, and use their data [1 3 ]. In a 2019 article [1 3 ], the researchers propose a viable blockchain-based model for researcher data collection",
    " that makes access verifiable, provides complete and updated information, and offers variable proof of provenance, including all accesses/shares/uses of the data. In this way, data owners not only enjoy greater transparency and protection of their data but may also be given an additional incentive through digital tokens, acknowledgements, or both, to share their data with data seekers and become active participants benefiting from the research data economy. One of the elements of data sharing is the easy availability of data and the opportunity for researchers/data owners to be rewarded with either digital tokens or recognition for their data collection efforts. The system gives registered users clear guidance on what smart contracts do with their data [ 4 ]. With their smart contract on the public Ethereum blockchain, researchers can retain ownership of their data and are rewarded according to agreed-upon terms. An example of this would be that users no longer need to log in with an \"",
    "@pravo.hr\" email address to access databases, a valid token holder could simply connect their wallet as confirmation and then access the relevant data as required. One of the examples of Web3 technologies providing the foundation for decentralized science is “The Open Science Decentralized Autonomous Organization” (OPSI), which is working with its community towards open scientific research workflows that are discoverable, accessible, interoperable, and repeatable. Its active working groups address decentralized file storage for research data management, variable scientific reputation, game-theoretic peer review, and the renewal of scientific work. Another potential impact of Web3 technologies is the provenance of research results. By having a simple process to connect their digital wallet, researchers increase their accountability by enabling transparent data collection and analysis by signing off on relevant entries and/or data transactions. This also gives participants the ability to",
    " take ownership of their data, empowering them and potentially increasing participation rates. This could be achieved through incentivising crowdsourced data collection. In this way, participants can sign up and receive tokens in return. One such example is Brave.com an Internet browser created around privacy, shielding its users from unsolicited advertisements and trackers, whilst allowing them to take control of their data, and even opt-in to a desired level of advertising in return for earning BAT coins (“Basic Attention Tokens”). An existing problem in research is that its organization and culture is increasingly centralized, hierarchical, topdown, and privatized. This includes the centralized organization of institutional research activities, research evaluation and funding, publishing, and the centralized view of the global research community [1 5 ]. Increasing centralization combined with its private commercialization contributes to challenges faced by the global research commun",
    "ity that include: a) an unsustainable business model, b) inflexible and inefficient funding, c) increasing inequality, d) fixed boundaries and \n\n\nsocial norms, e) inaccessibility, f) lack of transparency (detailed in [ 11 ]. One possible solution is the creation of a Global Research Decentralized Autonomous Organization (GR-DAO). A Global Research Decentralized Autonomous Organization (GR-DAO) has been proposed as a global community of researchers dedicated to collectively creating knowledge and sharing it with the world. As part of their DAO they support research activities such as: Research funding, research evaluation and assessment, research education, and the dissemination of scientific research via Open Access and Creative Commons licences in the public domain [ 11 ]. As a result, they provide the following solutions: a) They are faster: by utilizing smart contracts, research findings may be published more quickly allowing for more chances to be built upon. The acquisition of inf",
    "ormation and data may be done quickly by utilizing the data sharing platforms outlined above [ 11 ]; b) Anonymity and access: allows for the productive use of data that has been obtained in a secure way, as well as access to such data; c) Influence of culture: the notion of privacy and sharing and \"User-centric\" information that provides the feeling of safety. _B. Education: use cases_ There are already several Web3 projects building towards a new educational system, two of which stand out and we will highlight here. K12 Crypto is a free learn-to-earn platform for K12 students and schools that enables students to earn reservebacked stablecoins and other digital assets during their educational journey. Students can explore different learnto-earn curriculum on their platform, while schools can integrate the K12 crypto to unlock additional learner rewards and incentivize value-aligned metrics important to their communities. Upon graduation, students take full custody of their time-locked ",
    "wallets. The Educators at k20 are building the “Eduverse” – a metaverse hub for educators. Their mission is to connect educators from around the world to “collaborate transcending local obstacles to produce global solutions”. As the k20 founder Vriti Saraf says: _“For a very long time, our credentials have focused on grades and the name of the verifying institute. Instead, what if we focused on the output and performance, you’re able to gain? If I took a class on robotics, I could put the actual robot [coursework] on chain, not the grade. People could track the process, and it’s a much better indicator of who I am and what I learned.”_ Another project gaining a lot of traction in this space is \"CCS Crypto Culture and Society\" where people can come together to explore the broader social implications of Web3. As Jerry Yang, the Yahoo founder predicted, people from different backgrounds are building, contributing with their unique skillsets and perspectives to a better collective future. ",
    "Vriti Saraf and Courtland Leer (a co-founder of K12 Crypto) are educators, who are now on the frontier of building Web3 solutions to challenges in education. _C. Legal structure in practice_ Most of the emerging DAOs originated in the United States and have evolved in confrontation with the local U.S. regulatory environment. According to Aaron Wrights (founder of LexDAO and LAO), DAOs can be either “wrapped” or “unwrapped [15]. “Unwrapped” DAOs are not legally registered in any country and rely on their internal digital dispute resolution mechanisms to regulate the group. On the other hand, 'wrapped' DAOs use existing legal structures such as U.S.based corporations (e.g., a Delaware limited liability company (LLC)) to register DAO as a business or other nonprofit entity, giving it legal personality [1 5 ]. Membermanaged LLCs are permitted in the U.S., where no single registered manager or owner is required for the entity. In this structure, the members jointly manage the business with ",
    "limited liability protection and are not subject to joint and several liability [1 5 ]. The member-managed LLC structure fits the collective mechanisms of DAOs to some degree and has proven effective in the early stages. Recently, both Wyoming and Vermont have passed legislation allowing DAOs to register as LLCs or blockchain-based LLCs under their own names with legal personality. There is also a new regulatory regime from Malta that allows the registration of 'Innovative Technology Arrangements' or ITAs for Bitcoin technologies (DTLs) [1 5 ]. This will provide some level of government oversight and recognition for new and emerging forms of discontinuous innovation in legal, financial, organizational, and other applications of DTLs. While this system does not give legal personality to ITAs, it does provide a degree of certainty to stakeholders. This system is an applicationand technology-independent approach to regulation that considers new and discontinuous innovations on a case-by-c",
    "ase basis, allowing for greater flexibility in dealing with the emerging and potentially radical new applications of DLTs [1 5 ]. Given that DAOs will play an important role in the development of blockchain, DeFi, Web3, and governance, it is likely that a more permissive regulatory environment will be required in Croatia. Given that DAOs hold the promise of being massively scalable, efficient, and nonhierarchical organizations capable of disempowering players in various industries and providing innovation for governance in general, researchers and legal advisors should begin work on a potential regulatory framework in Croatia. _D. Future Implications_ We are just beginning to see the use of Web3 in a variety of areas, including research and education. The sheer volume of developers entering the Web3 space in these early days shows just how promising these technologies are. Web3 developers are already creating user-friendly platforms that allow non-technical people to work and interact ",
    "with Web3 technologies. One example is the development of Layer 2 technologies that enable lower cost, scalability, and higher throughput while preserving \n\n\nthe integrity of the original blockchain, allowing for further decentralization, transparency, and security. While Web3 gave rise to massive data centers to store, organize, and use people's data, these centralized stores are now being replaced with decentralized computing. The decentralized way of handling data will allow us to produce and consume 150 times more data in 2025 than in 2010 [1 2 ]. This upward trend will further advance the \"data economy\" by enabling people to take control of their own data and sell/trade (or otherwise) it as required without relying on third parties. Web3 is paving the way for a “trustless” future where people and machines can interact sharing services, data, and value without counterparties being involved leading to a human-centric, privacy-preserving computing structure for the next wave of the I",
    "nternet. IV. CONCLUSION As society’s data needs continue to evolve, the Web3 era is fundamentally changing many systems that have proven to be flawed, outdated and that have negatively impacted people's everyday lives. Some of these include finance, politics, news and social media and now research and education. Regardless, there are still a lot of challenges to be solved and regulations to be put in place to make this space both more human-friendly and trustworthy. This paper has explored some of the implications of Web3 in research and education, such as the potential of using a DAO framework for conducting research and testing hypotheses, as well as using blockchain-basedsolutions to tackle educational challenges. We’ve also touched on several initiatives to explain the context in which DAOs are an appropriate tool for research and for research outcome implementation. While Web1 was reserved exclusively for tech-savvy people and Web2 brought centralized problems with its inclusivity",
    ", Web3 is blazing a trail for inclusive, trustworthy systems built by people from all walks of life. The Web3 stack enables systematic change, and since we are still in the early stages, space is created for experimentation and learning by doing. Therefore, we invite researchers, lawyers, policy makers, and others to explore the possibilities of Web3 technologies and contribute to a better Internet. This paper might benefit decision makers in legal systems to further explore potential legal structures for Web3 technologies to be implemented in Croatian research and education as well as any other data driven systems. It can also help researchers and educators to get a general idea about potential of Web3 in the space. REFERENCES [1] H. L. Gururaj, A. A. Manoj, A. A. Kumar, A. M. Holla, S. M. Nagarajath, and V.

    "ow is currently evolving and has been evolving for decades and centuries. Communication is the most important tool for the progress of this world and its mankind. We have seen leaps in generations of communication technology in the last two decades alone. With such exponential growth in such a limited time brings out many challenges to overcome. The internet we use today is a network of networks connected and synchronized in real-time all over the world. This guarantees the proper functioning of various industries we use every single day, This leads to a very complex problemThe Centralization of the internet; which is both a boon and a bane. The good side is that the big tech companies who control the internet guarantee the service side of things ranging all the way from research, development, quality control, implementation, and maintenance and the competition among these big tech can keep the prices fairly competitive, However, this comes at a price, the price of not having privacy o",
    "ver your own data. These big corporations run ads as a way to remain profitable but they usually do that by accessing, analyzing, storing, and selling users' data to other companies that need them. Data is considered as the ‘New Gold’ in this modern day and age, data not only allows us to predict markets but also to manipulate them. This violates the privacy of the users of the internet around the globe ultimately profiting the big tech corporations. Here comes the \n\n\nnew internet revolution which would act as a solution to just that but at the same time guaranteeing the services listed above and also incentivizing them for regular users. WEB3 removes the dominance by the big tech corporations by bringing in the concept of decentralization using blockchain technology, This, in turn, has many new breakthroughs as a result of it, like digitalized decentralized currency(cryptocurrency) which is not connected to any centralized banks, Non-Fungible Tokens(NFT’s) which guarantee the ownershi",
    "p part of the property, Decentralized Finance(Defi), just to name a few In cryptography and Network Security, we follow a baseline model of the CIA triad (confidentiality, Integrity, and Authentication) to assess the level of security of the network. With web3 however, we guarantee all three aspects and also add another layer to guarantee the ownership of the data along the various blocks of the chain. In this thesis, my objective would be to better understand the inner workings of the web3 ecosystem and the various protocols it encompasses within thus allowing me to gain a profound knowledge to be ready for the future in sight. \n\n\n**Table of Contents Chapter 1 Introduction** ................................................................................................ 9 Evolution of the World Wide Web 3.0 .......................................................................... 11 Web 1.0 [1990 – 2000]:................................................................................",

Today, Internet has become ever increasing part of everyone’s life, the world over, in retrieving information and communication. Internet is a global network of computers, interconnected, all over the w",
    "orld, a network of Networks, using the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to communicate between networks and devices. There are companies, who provide the internet service into our homes and offices, called the Internet Service Providers (ISPs), offering several tiers of service with different internet speeds, usually measured in Mbps (megabits per second). Depending upon the Internet access requirement, one can connect to the internet using Modem. A router is used to connect a network (multiple computers and devices connected to form a wired or wireless network) to the internet. The World Wide Web (WWW), has become very prominent in Internet Technologies, supporting the development. It has collection of documents, that can be retrieved by a web browser, formatted in a language called the HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and HTTP protocol to transmit and share information. Web1 was read-only static web page, with no visual elements, limited user interaction, and the users were just cons",
    "umers of the information. \n\n\nWeb2 is defined as read-write web. With the advancement of web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, & Ajax opened a whole lot of possibilities to build Dynamic Websites, giving rich user experience. This led to the Social Media (Facebook) and Web Platforms (Google & Amazon) era, which eventually made users more addictive, and companies started monetizing on user data. The lack of user privacy, Data breaches, Single point of failure, risk of censorship and security led to Web3. Web3 is defined as 'read, write and execute', using decentralized blockchain-based platforms that give control to users. This means that no one can gain access to private user data or remove users’ content, while avoiding the risk of hacking. The shift to blockchain technology will make it open, transparent, decentralized and peer-to-peer network. _1 Evolution of Internet_ \n\n\nThere is shift from cloud storage to IPFS, the centralized operating system to EOS and Ethereum, decentral",
    "ized social networks, and growth of DAOs. You can notice how web3 is indeed the future with transitions from centralized systems and processes towards decentralized blockchain networks. Evolution of the World Wide Web 3.0 Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, intended that the internet would be a collaborative medium, a place where all meet and read and write. But today, its has evolved entirely opposite, with big tech companies acting as gatekeepers to all that’s on the World Wide Web Web 1.0 [1990 – 2000]: It is regarded as the first generation of the World Wide Web. Also known as the Syntactic web or Read only web. Mostly, Web 1.0 was limited to searching the info and reading what’s already there. There was very little in the way of user interaction or content contribution. It was pretty disorganized and overwhelming, and soon it came to be dominated by AOL, Compuserve, early Yahoo and other portals. These online service providers were the gateway to Web 1.0. Web 1.0 ",
    "was with dialup with an average internet speed of 50 kbps, and email was much used, cataloguing and e-commerce driven. Web 2.0 [from mid-2000s]: This phase was characterised by enhanced user experience and made the W3 interactive. Also known as Social Web or read-write web. It enabled users to participate in content creation on social networks, blogs, sharing sites and more. Search engines (Google) and social \n\n\nmedia platforms (Facebook, Twitter) driven by user-generated content disrupted the media, advertising and retail industries. Web 2.0’s business model relies on user participation to create fresh content and the resultant data being sold to third parties for marketing purposes. The Web 2.0, had Broadband with an average internet speed of 1 Mbps, with XML, Web-services, Ajax, and growth of seamlessly connecting applications, social web and entertainment driven. Web 3.0 : It is the next stage of the web evolution. It would make the internet more intelligent, or process information",
    " with near-human-like intelligence through the power of AI systems. The Web 3.0, we have Mobile connectivity with 10 Mbps and Personalization driven. \n\n## 2 Evolution of Web \n\n### WHY WE NEED WEB 3.0? \n\nLoss of privacy: Presently, a huge amount of data is generated when consumers search, shop or upload videos and pictures. All this data is \n\n\nstored in the servers of the companies that the people interact with. This means that intermediaries become custodians of user data and profit from it via advertising. Data ownership: Presently, only centralized repositories are the ones that own user data and profit from it. In Web 3.0, users can own and be properly compensated for their time and data. Plagiarism: Plagiarism is widespread online. It’s very easy to copy original content and build a following around it on social media. Those who copy content get compensated way more than the original content creator. Plagiarism makes it harder for creators to get adequately compensated. Web3 would ",
    "be helpful in addressing the issue. The transparent nature of blockchain makes it easy for anyone to track the originator of content. What are the key differences between Web 2.0 and Web 3.0? \n\n\n_3 Differences between WEB2 and Web3_ Any information that users share on Web 2.0 is stored with a cloud service provider used by an online service, whether it is food delivery or e-commerce, whereas, in Web3, all services are built on top of a blockchain. Cloud is controlled by giants such as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, and is centralized. In the case of blockchain, data is distributed across networks and no single entity owns the information. \n\n\n_4 Evolution of WEB A Comparative Analysis_ \n\n\n# Chapter 2 What is the WEB 3.0? \n\nThe world is always evolving and so is the internet. The internet is the main key factor that holds communication intact in this day of our generation. The internet has, is, and will be evolving to make this world a faster and safer place for all of us to exist. The i",
    "nternet in its earlier stages was first created as a means of connection of network among networks. With the creation of ARPANET, the scientists in the computer world discovered the importance of communication and the extent to which it could be developed and paved the way for WEB1.0. The internet is composed of 5 main layers, the physical layer, the link layer, the network layer, the transport layer, and the application layer. There have been many noticeable developments in the application and physical layers respectively, but the very concept of the internet first introduced did not have security in the main structure WEB1.0 simply put was a means of loading and viewing static web pages, having its own limitations and vulnerabilities in the realm there came the WEB2.0. The WEB2.0 however brought up a rapid adoption of internet and internet services all around the globe rapidly increasing the active users in the space. This technology added multiple layers of services through enhancem",
    "ents in the application layer. A few of the many breakthroughs include social media services (Facebook/Instagram), e-commerce websites(amazon/eBay), and media and entertainment streaming services (Netflix/YouTube/twitch). The web 2.0 however has many limitations although given its wide adoption creates a realm of vulnerabilities and concerns to be addressed \n\n\nHere comes WEB3.0. This new platform is based on the blockchain technology which results in a much more secure and decentralized enclave. This gives an added advantage for the token based economics. As with the previous generations of the internet Introduction to Web3 Centralization has helped onboard billions of people to the World Wide Web and created the stable, robust infrastructure on which it lives. At the same time, a handful of centralized entities have a stronghold on large swathes of the World Wide Web, unilaterally deciding what should and should not be allowed. Web3 is the answer to this dilemma. Instead of a Web mono",
    "polized by large technology companies, Web3 embraces decentralization and is being built, operated, and owned by its users. Web3 puts power in the hands of individuals rather than corporations. Before we talk about Web3, let's explore how we got here. The early Web Most people think of the Web as a continuous pillar of modern life—it was invented and has just existed since. However, the Web most of us know today is quite different from originally imagined. To understand this better, it's helpful to break the Web's short history into loose periods—Web 1.0 and Web 2.0. Web 1.0: Read-Only (1990-2004) In 1989, at CERN, Geneva, Tim Berners-Lee was busy developing the protocols that would become the World Wide Web. His idea? To \n\n\ncreate open, decentralized protocols that allowed information-sharing from anywhere on Earth. The first inception of Berners-Lee's creation, now known as 'Web 1.0', occurred roughly between 1990 to 2004. Web 1.0 was mainly static websites owned by companies, and th",
    "ere was close to zero interaction between users individuals seldom produced content leading to it being known as the read-only web. Web 2.0: Read-Write (2004-now) The Web 2.0 period began in 2004 with the emergence of social media platforms. Instead of a read-only, the web evolved to be read-write. Instead of companies providing content to users, they also began to provide platforms to share user-generated content and engage in user-to-user interactions. As more people came online, a handful of top companies began to control a disproportionate amount of the traffic and value generated on the web. Web 2.0 also birthed the advertising-driven revenue model. While users could create content, they didn't own it or benefit from its monetization. Web 3.0: Read-Write-Own The premise of 'Web 3.0' was coined by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood shortly after Ethereum launched in 2014. Gavin put into words a solution for a problem that many early crypto adopters felt: the Web required too much trust",
    ". That is, most of the Web that people know and use today relies on trusting a handful of private companies to act in the public's best interests. Decentralized node architecture, representing Web3 \n\n\nWhat is Web3? Web3 has become a catch-all term for the vision of a new, better internet. At its core, Web3 uses blockchains, cryptocurrencies, and NFTs to give power back to the users in the form of ownership. A 2020 post on Twitter said it best: Web1 was read-only, Web2 is read-write, Web3 will be read-write-own. _Core ideas of Web3_ Although it's challenging to provide a rigid definition of what Web3 is, a few core principles guide its creation. Web3 is decentralized: instead of large swathes of the internet controlled and owned by centralized entities, ownership gets distributed amongst its builders and users. Web3 is permissionless: everyone has equal access to participate in Web3, and no one gets excluded. Web3 has native payments: it uses cryptocurrency for spending and sending mone",
    "y online instead of relying on the outdated infrastructure of banks and payment processors. Web3 is trustless: it operates using incentives and economic mechanisms instead of relying on trusted third-parties. Why is Web3 important? Although Web3's killer features aren't isolated and don't fit into neat categories, for simplicity we've tried to separate them to make them easier to understand. \n\n\nOwnership Web3 gives you ownership of your digital assets in an unprecedented way. For example, say you're playing a web2 game. If you purchase an in-game item, it is tied directly to your account. If the game creators delete your account, you will lose these items. Or, if you stop playing the game, you lose the value you invested into your in-game items. Web3 allows for direct ownership through non-fungible tokens (NFTs). No one, not even the game's creators, has the power to take away your ownership. And, if you stop playing, you can sell or trade your in-game items on open markets and recoup ",
    "their value. What's an NFT? NFTs are tokens that we can use to represent ownership of unique items. They let us tokenize things like art, collectibles, even real estate. Ownership of an asset is secured by the Ethereum blockchain – no one can modify the record of ownership or copy/paste a new NFT into existence. NFT stands for non-fungible token. Non-fungible is an economic term that you could use to describe things like your furniture, a song file, or your computer. These things are not interchangeable for other items because they have unique properties. Fungible items, on the other hand, can be exchanged because their value defines them rather than their unique properties. For example, ETH or dollars are fungible because 1 ETH / $1 USD is exchangeable for another 1 ETH / $1 USD. \n\n\nA comparison between an NFT internet and the internet today (https://ethereum.org/en/nft/) NFT Internet NFTs are digitally unique, no two NFTs are the same. Every NFT must have an owner and this is of publ",
    "ic record and easy for anyone to verify. NFTs are compatible with anything built using Ethereum. An NFT ticket for an event can be traded on every Ethereum marketplace, for an entirely different NFT. You could trade a piece of art for a ticket! Content creators can sell their work anywhere and can access a global market. Creators can retain ownership rights over their own work, and claim resale royalties directly. Items can be used in surprising ways. For example, you can use digital artwork as collateral in a decentralised loan. \n\n\nInternet Today A copy of a file, like an .mp3 or .jpg, is the same as the original. Ownership records of digital items are stored on servers controlled by institutions – you must take their word for it. Companies with digital items must build their own infrastructure. For example an app that issues digital tickets for events would have to build their own ticket exchange. Creators rely on the infrastructure and distribution of the platforms they use. These a",
    "re often subject to terms of use and geographical restrictions. Ethereum and NFTs Ethereum makes it possible for NFTs to work for a number of reasons: Transaction history and token metadata is publicly verifiable – it's simple to prove ownership history. Once a transaction is confirmed, it's nearly impossible to manipulate that data to \"steal\" ownership. Trading NFTs can happen peer-to-peer without needing platforms that can take large cuts as compensation. All Ethereum products share the same \"backend\". Put another way, all Ethereum products can easily understand each other – this makes NFTs portable across products. You can buy an NFT on one product \n\n\nand sell it on another easily. As a creator you can list your NFTs on multiple products at the same time – every product will have the most up-to-date ownership information. Ethereum never goes down, meaning your tokens will always be available to sell. _NFT security_ Ethereum's security comes from proof-of-stake. The system is designe",
    "d to economically disincentivize malicious actions, making Ethereum tamper-proof. This is what makes NFTs possible. Once the block containing your NFT transaction becomes finalized it would cost an attacker millions of ETH to change it. Anyone running Ethereum software would immediately be able to detect dishonest tampering with an NFT, and the bad actor would be economically penalized and ejected. Security issues relating to NFTs are most often related to phishing scams, smart contract vulnerabilities or user errors (such as inadvertently exposing private keys), making good wallet security critical for NFT owners. A blockchain is a database of transactions that is updated and shared across many computers in a network. Every time a new set of transactions is added, its called a “block” hence the name blockchain. Most blockchains are public, and you can only add data, not remove. If someone wanted to alter any of the information or cheat the system, they’d need to do so on the majority ",
    "of computers on the network. \n\n\nThat is a lot! This makes established blockchains like Ethereum highly secure \n\n\n# Chapter 3 What is a blockchain? \n\nBlockchain^1 is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system. _5 Blockchain_ A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain. Each block in the chain contains a number of transactions, and every time a new transaction occurs on the blockchain, a record of that transaction is added to every participant’s ledger. The decentralised database managed by multiple participants is known as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Blockchain is a type of DLT in which transactions are recorded with an immutable cryptographic signature called a hash. 1 \n\n\nThis means if one block in one chain was changed, it would be immediately apparent it had been tampered with. If hacker",
    "s wanted to corrupt a blockchain system, they would have to change every block in the chain, across all of the distributed versions of the chain. _6 Blockchain Application_ Blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are constantly and continually growing as blocks are being added to the chain, which significantly adds to the security of the ledger. \n\n\n_7 Distributed Ledger Technology DLT_ Proof of Work vs Proof of Stake “Proof of work” and “proof of stake” are the two major consensus mechanisms cryptocurrencies use to verify new transactions, add them to the blockchain, and create new tokens. Proof of work, first pioneered by Bitcoin, uses mining to achieve those goals. Proof of stake — which is employed by Cardano, the ETH2 blockchain, and others — uses staking to achieve the same things. Decentralized cryptocurrency networks need to make sure that nobody spends the same money twice without a central authority like Visa or PayPal in the middle. To accomplish this, networks use something",
    " called a “consensus mechanism,” which is a system that allows all the computers in a crypto network to agree about which transactions are legitimate. \n\n\n_8 Proof of Work and Stake Difference What is proof of work?_ Proof of work is the original crypto consensus mechanism, first used by Bitcoin. Proof of work and mining are closely related ideas. The reason it’s called “proof of work” is because the network requires a huge amount of processing power. Proof-of-work blockchains are secured and verified by virtual miners around the world racing to be the first to solve a math puzzle. The winner gets to update the blockchain with the latest verified transactions and is rewarded by the network with a predetermined amount of crypto. Proof of work has some powerful advantages, especially for a relatively simple but hugely valuable cryptocurrency like Bitcoin (learn more about how Bitcoin works). It’s a proven, robust way of maintaining a \n\n\nsecure decentralized blockchain. As the value of a c",
    "ryptocurrency grows, more miners are incentivized to join the network, increasing its power and security. Because of the amount of processing power involved, it becomes impractical for any individual or group to meddle with a valuable cryptocurrency’s blockchain. On the flip side, it’s an energy-intensive process that can have trouble scaling to accommodate the vast number of transactions smartcontract compatible blockchains like Ethereum can generate. And so alternatives have been developed, the most popular of which is called proof of stake. What is proof of stake? Ethereum’s developers understood from the beginning that proof of work would present limitations in scalability that would eventually need to be overcome — and, indeed, as Ethereum-powered decentralized finance (or DeFi) protocols have surged in popularity, the blockchain has struggled to keep up, causing fees to spike. While the Bitcoin blockchain mostly just has to process incoming and outgoing bitcoin transactions, much",
    " like a vast check book, Ethereum’s blockchain also has to process a vast array of DeFi transactions, stablecoin smart contracts, NFT minting and sales, and whatever innovations developers come up with in the future. Their solution has been to build an entirely new ETH2 blockchain — which began rolling out in December 2020 and should be finished in \n\n2022. The upgraded version of Ethereum will employ a faster and less resource intensive consensus mechanism called proof of stake. \n\n\nCryptocurrencies including Cardano, Tezos, and Atmos all use proofof-stake consensus mechanisms — with the goal being to maximize speed and efficiency while lowering fees. In a proof of stake system, staking serves a similar function to proof of work’s mining, in that it’s the process by which a network participant gets selected to add the latest batch of transactions to the blockchain and earn some crypto in exchange. The exact details vary by project, but in general proof of stake blockchains employ a netw",
    "ork of “validators” who contribute — or “stake” — their own crypto in exchange for a chance of getting to validate new transaction, update the blockchain, and earn a reward. The network selects a winner based on the amount of crypto each validator has in the pool and the length of time they’ve had it there — literally rewarding the most invested participants. Once the winner has validated the latest block of transactions, other validators can attest that the block is accurate. When a threshold number of attestations have been made, the network updates the blockchain. All participating validators receive a reward in the native cryptocurrency, which is generally distributed by the network in proportion to each validator’s stake. Becoming a validator is a major responsibility and requires a fairly high level of technical knowledge. The minimum amount of crypto that validators are required to stake is often relatively high (for ETH2, for \n\n\nexample, it’s 32 ETH) and validators can lose som",
    "e of their stake via a process called slashing if their node goes offline or if they validate a “bad” block of transactions. But even if that sounds like too much responsibility, you can still participate in staking by joining a staking pool run by someone else — and earn rewards for crypto that would otherwise be sitting around. This process is often referred to as delegating, and tools offered by exchanges by Coinbase can make it simple and seamless. What are some differences between proof of work and proof of stake? Energy consumption is one major difference between the two consensus mechanisms. Because proof-of-stake blockchains don’t require miners to spend electricity on duplicative processes (competing to solve the same puzzle), proof of stake allows networks to operate with substantially lower resource consumption. Both consensus mechanisms have economic consequences that penalize network disruptions and thwart malicious actors. In proof of work, the penalty for miners submitti",
    "ng invalid information, or blocks, is the sunk cost of computing power, energy, and time. In proof of stake, the validators’ staked crypto funds serve as an economic incentive to act in the network’s best interests. In the case that a validator accepts a bad block, a portion of their staked funds will be “slashed” as a penalty. The amount that a validator can be slashed depends on the network. \n\n\n_9 Proof of Work and Stake Pros and Cons_ \n\n\nBlockchain in Detail Blockchain technology was first outlined in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta, two researchers who wanted to implement a system where document timestamps could not be tampered with. But it wasn’t until almost two decades later, with the launch of Bitcoin in January 2009, that blockchain had its first real-world application. A blockchain is a distributed database or ledger that is shared among the nodes of a computer network. As a database, a blockchain stores information electronically in a digital format. Blockchains ",
    "are best known for their crucial role in cryptocurrency systems, such as Bitcoin, for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions. The innovation of a blockchain is that it guarantees the fidelity and security of a record of data and generates trust without the need for a trusted third party. One key difference between a typical database and a blockchain is how the data is structured. A blockchain collects information together in groups, known as blocks, that hold sets of information. Blocks have certain storage capacities and, when filled, are closed and linked to the previously filled block, forming a chain of data known as the blockchain. All new information that follows that freshly added block is compiled into a newly formed block that will then also be added to the chain once filled. A database usually structures its data into tables, whereas a blockchain, as its name implies, structures its data into chunks (blocks) that are strung together. This data structure",
    " inherently makes an irreversible timeline of data when implemented in a decentralized \n\n\nnature. When a block is filled, it is set in stone and becomes a part of this timeline. Each block in the chain is given an exact timestamp when it is added to the chain. How Does a Blockchain Work? The goal of blockchain is to allow digital information to be recorded and distributed, but not edited. In this way, a blockchain is the foundation for immutable ledgers, or records of transactions that cannot be altered, deleted, or destroyed. This is why blockchains are also known as a distributed ledger technology (DLT). _10 Blockchain transaction_ \n\n\nBlockchain Decentralization What a blockchain does is to allow the data held in that database to be spread out among several network nodes at various locations. This not only creates redundancy but also maintains the fidelity of the data stored therein—if somebody tries to alter a record at one instance of the database, the other nodes would not be alte",
    "red and thus would prevent a bad actor from doing so. This system helps to establish an exact and transparent order of events. This way, no single node within the network can alter information held within it. To validate new entries or records to a block, a majority of the decentralized network’s computing power would need to agree to it. To prevent bad actors from validating bad transactions or double spends, blockchains are secured by a consensus mechanism such as proof of work (PoW) or proof of stake (PoS). These mechanisms allow for agreement even when no single node is in charge. Transparency all transactions can be transparently viewed by either having a personal node or using blockchain explorers that allow anyone to see transactions occurring live. Each node has its own copy of the chain that gets updated as fresh blocks are confirmed and added. Blockchain Security Blockchain technology achieves decentralized security and trust in several ways. To begin with, new blocks are alw",
    "ays stored linearly and chronologically. That is, they are always added to the “end” of the blockchain. After a block has been added to the end of the blockchain, it is extremely difficult to go back and alter the contents of the block \n\n\nunless a majority of the network has reached a consensus to do so. That’s because each block contains its own hash, along with the hash of the block before it, as well as the previously mentioned timestamp. Hash codes are created by a mathematical function that turns digital information into a string of numbers and letters. If that information is edited in any way, then the hash code changes as well. How Are Blockchains Used? Some companies that have already incorporated blockchain include Walmart, Pfizer, AIG, Siemens, Unilever, and a host of others. For example, IBM has created its Food Trust blockchain to trace the journey that food products take to get to their locations. Why do this? The food industry has seen countless outbreaks of E. coli, salm",
    "onella, and listeria, as well as hazardous materials being accidentally introduced to foods. In the past, it has taken weeks to find the source of these outbreaks or the cause of sickness from what people are eating. Using blockchain gives brands the ability to track a food product’s route from its origin, through each stop it makes, and finally, its delivery. If a food is found to be contaminated, then it can be traced all the way back through each stop to its origin. Not only that, but these companies can also now see everything else it may have come in contact with, allowing the identification of the problem to occur far sooner and potentially saving lives. This is one example of blockchain in practice, but there are many other forms of blockchain implementation. \n\n\n_Banking and Finance_ Financial institutions stand to benefit from integrating blockchain into its business operations more than any other industry. By integrating blockchain into banks, consumers can see their transacti",
    "ons processed in very little time—basically the time it takes to add a block to the blockchain, regardless of holidays or the time of day or week. The banks also can exchange funds between institutions more quickly and securely. In the stock trading business, for example, the settlement and clearing process can take up to three days (or longer, if trading internationally), meaning that the money and shares are frozen for that period of time. Given the size of the sums involved, even the few days that the money is in transit can carry significant costs and risks for Institution. _Currency_ Blockchain forms the bedrock for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The blockchain allows Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to operate without the need for a central authority. This not only reduces risk but also eliminates many of the processing and transaction fees. Using cryptocurrency wallets for savings accounts. _Healthcare_ Healthcare providers can leverage blockchain to securely store their patie",
    "nts’ medical records. When a medical record is generated and signed, it can be written into the blockchain, which provides patients with the proof and confidence that the record cannot be changed. These personal health records could be encoded and stored on the blockchain with a private key, so that they are only accessible by certain individuals, thereby ensuring privacy. \n\n\n_Property Records_ Blockchain has the potential to eliminate the need for scanning documents and tracking down physical files in a local recording office. If property ownership is stored and verified on the blockchain, owners can trust that their deed is accurate and permanently recorded. _Smart Contracts_ A smart contract is a computer code that can be built into the blockchain to facilitate, verify, or negotiate a contract agreement. Smart contracts operate under a set of conditions to which users agree. When those conditions are met, the terms of the agreement are automatically carried out. _Supply Chains_ As i",
    "n the IBM Food Trust example, suppliers can use blockchain to record the origins of materials that they have purchased. This would allow companies to verify the authenticity of not only their products but also common labels such as “Organic,” “Local,” and “Fair Trade.” As reported by Forbes, the food industry is increasingly adopting the use of blockchain to track the path and safety of food throughout the farm-to-user journey. _Voting_ Voting with blockchain carries the potential to eliminate election fraud and boost voter turnout, as was tested in the November 2018 midterm elections in West Virginia. Using blockchain in this way would make votes nearly impossible to tamper with. The blockchain protocol would also maintain transparency in the electoral process, reducing the personnel needed \n\n\nto conduct an election and providing officials with nearly instant results. This would eliminate the need for recounts or any real concern that fraud might threaten the election. Benefits of Blo",
    "ckchains Accuracy of the Blockchain Transactions on the blockchain network are approved by a network of thousands of computers. This removes almost all human involvement in the verification process, resulting in less human error and an accurate record of information. Even if a computer on the network were to make a computational mistake, the error would only be made to one copy of the blockchain. For that error to spread to the rest of the blockchain, it would need to be made by at least 51% of the network’s computers—a near impossibility for a large and growing network the size of Bitcoin. _Cost Reductions_ Typically, consumers pay a bank to verify a transaction, a notary to sign a document, or a minister to perform a marriage. Blockchain eliminates the need for third-party verification—and, with it, their associated costs. For example, business owners incur a small fee whenever they accept payments using credit cards, because banks and payment-processing companies have to process tho",
    "se transactions. Bitcoin, on the other hand, does not have a central authority and has limited transaction fees. _Decentralization_ Blockchain does not store any of its information in a central location. Instead, the blockchain is copied and spread across a network of computers. Whenever a new block is added to the blockchain, every \n\n\ncomputer on the network updates its blockchain to reflect the change. By spreading that information across a network, rather than storing it in one central database, blockchain becomes more difficult to tamper with. If a copy of the blockchain fell into the hands of a hacker, only a single copy of the information, rather than the entire network, would be compromised. \n\n\nChapter 4 (^) **WHY DO WE NEED DECENTRALIZATION?** Fault tolerance Decentralized systems are less likely to fail accidentally because they rely on many separate components that are not likely. Attack resistance Decentralized systems are more expensive to attack and destroy or manipulate b",
    "ecause they lack sensitive central points that can be attacked at much lower cost than the economic size of the surrounding system. Collusion resistance It is much harder for participants in decentralized systems to collude to act in ways that benefit them at the expense of other participants, whereas the leaderships of corporations and governments collude in ways that benefit themselves but harm less well-coordinated citizens, customers, employees, and the general public all the time. Three types of Decentralization Decentralization isn't simply how many nodes a blockchain network has, or how many validators are online at a specific hour. Vitalik divides decentralization into three different forms. Architectural (de)centralization — how many physical computers is a system made up of? How many of those computers can it tolerate breaking down at any single time? Political (de)centralization — how many individuals or organizations ultimately control the computers that the system is made ",
    "up of? \n\n\nLogical (de)centralization — does the interface and data structures that the system presents and maintains look more like a single monolithic object, or an amorphous swarm? One simple heuristic is: if you cut the system in half, including both providers and users, will both halves continue to fully operate as independent units? https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-ofdecentralization-a0c92b76a274. Characteristics of a Decentralized Application/System (Service) Read + Write + Own. Permission-less: anyone can use the Service Open, transparent: the source code is available, and the user can verify every part of the Service Censorship-resistant: no company, entity, or government can suppress your actions because they don't have control over the Service, hence can't exercise the control Cryptocurrency (optional): you can make payments. There can be a decentralized protocol like Hyperledger without a native token. Still, I believe Money is such a fundamental concept in lif",
    "e that I am adding it as a characteristic. People must have a way to exchange value without giving up control to a centralized entity like a Big Tech Monopoly or a Government controlled bank Web3 architecture may seem complex at first look as it requires a lot of independent components to achieve the decentralized concepts. \n\n\n_Efficient Transactions_ Transactions placed through a central authority can take up to a few days to settle. If you attempt to deposit a check on Friday evening, for example, you may not actually see funds in your account until Monday morning. Whereas financial institutions operate during business hours, usually five days a week, blockchain is working 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and 365 days a year. Transactions can be completed in as little as 10 minutes and can be considered secure after just a few hours. This is particularly useful for cross-border trades, which usually take much longer because of time zone issues and the fact that all parties must con",
    "firm payment processing. _Private Transactions_ Many blockchain networks operate as public databases, meaning that anyone with an Internet connection can view a list of the network’s transaction history. Although users can access details about transactions, they cannot access identifying information about the users making those transactions. It is a common misperception that blockchain networks like bitcoin are anonymous, when in fact they are only confidential. When a user makes a public transaction, their unique code—called a public key, as mentioned earlier—is recorded on the blockchain. Their personal information is not. If a person has made a Bitcoin purchase on an exchange that requires identification, then the person’s identity is still linked to their blockchain address—but a transaction, even when tied to a person’s name, does not reveal any personal information. \n\n\n_Secure Transactions_ Once a transaction is recorded, its authenticity must be verified by the blockchain networ",
    "k. Thousands of computers on the blockchain rush to confirm that the details of the purchase are correct. After a computer has validated the transaction, it is added to the blockchain block. Each block on the blockchain contains its own unique hash, along with the unique hash of the block before it. When the information on a block is edited in any way, that block’s hash code changes—however, the hash code on the block after it would not. This discrepancy makes it extremely difficult for information on the blockchain to be changed without notice. _Transparency_ Most blockchains are entirely open-source software. This means that anyone and everyone can view its code. This gives auditors the ability to review cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin for security. This also means that there is no real authority on who controls Bitcoin’s code or how it is edited. Because of this, anyone can suggest changes or upgrades to the system. If a majority of the network users agree that the new version of the ",
    "code with the upgrade is sound and worthwhile, then Bitcoin can be updated. What Is a Blockchain Platform? A blockchain platform allows users and developers to create novel uses on top of an existing blockchain infrastructure. One example is Ethereum, which has a native cryptocurrency known as ether (ETH). \n\n\n_The Bottom Line_ With many practical applications for the technology already being implemented and explored, blockchain is finally making a name for itself and stands to make business and government operations more accurate, efficient, secure, and cheap, with fewer middlemen. \n\n\n# Chapter 5 DECENTRALIZATION \n\nKey principles of Web3 (5)Although, it's challenging to provide a rigid definition of what Web3 is, a few core principles guide its creation. **Web3 is decentralized** : instead of large swathes of the internet controlled and owned by centralized entities, ownership gets distributed amongst its builders and users. **Web3 is permissionless** : everyone has equal access to par",
    "ticipate in Web3, and no one gets excluded. **Web3 has native payments** : it uses cryptocurrency for spending and sending money online instead of relying on the outdated infrastructure of banks and payment processors. **Web3 is trustless** : it operates using incentives and economic mechanisms instead of relying on trusted third parties. DECENTRALIZED AUTONOMOUS ORGANIZATIONS (DAOS) As well as owning your data in Web3, you can own the platform as a collective, using tokens that act like shares in a company. **DAOs** let you coordinate decentralized ownership of a platform and make decisions about its future. **DAOs** are defined technically as agreed-upon smart contracts that automate decentralized decision-making over a pool of resources (tokens). Users with tokens vote on how resources get spent, and the code automatically performs the voting outcome. \n\n\nHowever, people define many Web3 communities as **DAOs**. These communities all have different levels of decentralization and auto",
    "mation by code. Currently, we are exploring what DAOs are and how they might evolve in the future. **(6)DAOs** transform the same organization into a decentralized one. Instead of a hierarchical structure managed by a set of humans interacting in person and controlling property via a legal system, DAOs have a set of humans interacting with each other according to a protocol specified in code, enforced on the blockchain Membership Membership in a DAO is granted through one of these 2 ways: Token-based membership In a token-based membership system, certain tokens are granted to members, that grant the members voting rights proportionate to their token holdings. Any member could be granted certain tokens in a DAO if they invest as part of a coin offering, or if they provide liquidity or any other proof of work. These are automatic and do not need any permission. Leaving the DAO would be easy by just selling the tokens in the open market. Shared Based membership This particular concept is ",
    "new and not quite common in the sphere. It needs the person to provide a proposal, offering tribute in terms of money or work. Similar to the shares in a conventional corporation, shares represent the voting power and ownership in the organization. Both the types are not the same as in shared based membership may be redeemed upon exit and the exiting member can receive the proportionate share of the treasury \n\n\nTraditional Organizations VS. DAOs In traditional companies, all agents of a company have employment contracts that regulate their relationship with the organization and with each other. Their rights and obligations are regulated by legal contracts and enforced by a legal system which is subject to the underlying governing law of the country they reside in. If anything goes wrong, or someone does not stick to their end of the bargain, the legal contract will define who can be sued for what in a court of law. DAOs, on the other hand, involve a set of people interacting with each ",
    "other according to a self-enforcing open-source protocol. Keeping the network safe and performing other network tasks is rewarded with the native network tokens. Blockchains and smart contracts hereby reduce transaction costs of management at higher levels of transparency, aligning the interests of all stakeholders by the consensus rules tied to the native token. Individual behaviour is incentivized with a token to collectively contribute to a common goal. \n\n\n# Chapter 6 TOKEN ECONOMICS \n\n“A token contract is a special type of smart contract that defines a bundle of conditional rights assigned to the token holder. They are rights management tools that can represent any existing digital or physical asset, or access rights to assets someone else owns. Tokens can represent anything from a store of value to a set of permissions in the physical, digital, and legal world. They facilitate collaboration across markets and jurisdictions and allow more transparent, efficient, and fair interactio",
    "ns between market participants, at low costs. Tokens can also incentivize an autonomous group of people to individually contribute to a collective goal” Excerpt From Token Economy: How the Web3 reinvents the Internet Shermin Voshmgir _11 Tokenomics_ \n\n\n(9) The first blockchain tokens were the native tokens of public and permissionless blockchain networks. These native tokens—also referred to as protocol tokens—are part of the incentive scheme of blockchain infrastructure. With the advent of Ethereum, however, tokens have moved up the technology stack and can now be issued on the application layer. Such application tokens can have simple or complex behaviors attached to them. Ethereum made it particularly easy to issue tokens with a few lines of code. Standardized smart contracts like the “ERC-20” standard define a common list of rules for Ethereum tokens, including how the tokens are transferred from one Ethereum address to another and how data within each token is accessed. These toke",
    "n contracts manage the logic and maintain a list of all issued tokens, and can represent any asset that has features of a fungible commodity. A vast majority of early tokens issued on the Ethereum network have been ERC-20 compliant fungible tokens. Fungibility refers to the fact that every token has an identical value with any other token of the same kind and can be easily traded. \n\n\n**_12_** _History of WEB_ \n\n\n# Chapter 7 FUTURE IN-SIGHT \n\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi): Toward a Digital Barter Economy (11) Cryptographic tokens represent a new heterogenous asset class that can fulfill a diverse range of economic functions. Their frictionless issuance and settlement process could potentially convert many assets or access rights of the real world into “bankable funds.” Tokenizing economic activities, from real assets to digital assets and all types of access rights, could impact the role of central bank money as a geographical monopolist providing a medium of exchange, once mass adoption",
    " of the Web3 manifests and necessary network effects kick in. The speed at which these tokens are being issued is an indicator that a new tokenized economic system is emerging. Such tokenization of the real economy could gradually lead to the merging of the money system, with the financial system and the real economy. _13 Future of WEB3_ \n\n\nA range of easy-to-use decentralized financial (DeFi) applications have been emerging beyond simple payments networks that facilitate frictional and P2P asset issuance, trading, lending and hedging. The term “DeFi” encompasses any decentralized and permissionless financial application that builds on top of distributed ledgers, including privacy-preserving payment systems (privacy tokens), stability preserving payment systems (stable tokens), P2P exchanges (token exchanges), P2P fundraising (token sales), and P2P credit and lending (decentralized lending), P2P insurance, and a growing list of P2P derivatives. These Web3-based DeFi applications could,",
    " potentially, open traditional financial services to the general public, mitigating current inefficiencies of financial markets. The current financial system, even in it’s electronic form, requires a range of intermediary services for (i) mitigating counterparty risk, (ii) market making, and (iii) securing funds from being stolen. This is a result of the server-centric nature of the current Internet. In a tokenized economy, however, distributed ledgers and user-centric identity solutions could increase ecosystem transparency, accountability, and market efficiency: Due to the public nature of distributed ledgers, DeFi applications are designed to be globally accessible by anyone around the world with an Internet connection and a Web3 wallet. Once the smart contract is deployed, DeFi applications self-execute with little institutional intervention except for code upgrades, bug fixes, and dispute resolution. \n\n\nIf users choose “non-custodial” wallet solutions, they remain in possession of",
    " the private keys and in full control of the funds, potentially disintermediating many financial services that currently provide services to mitigate counterparty risk, act as market makers, or secure funds from being stolen. Any smart contract code can be audited by anyone and is subject to collective loophole fixing, which is the basis for the rapidly evolving DeFi ecosystem. All token transactions are publicly verifiable, reducing market friction and increasing the interoperability of financial services. As a result of such interoperability, DeFi applications can be built in a modular way, which is why many refer to them as “money legos.” \n\n\n_14 Centralized and Decentralized Finance_ Combining various DeFi solutions, such as “stable tokens,” “decentralized exchanges,” and “decentralized lending,” can produce completely new products available to retail investors and the general public. Any private person could, in such a setup, tokenize their real assets and use them as collateral fo",
    "r P2P lending solutions without bureaucracy by using a combination of simple DeFi applications. Such new services could, in the long run, change the dynamics of our economic system and contribute to the merging of the real economy and the financial system, making their distinction increasingly impossible. \n\n\n# Chapter 8 CONCLUSION \n\nWeb 3.0 has sprung as a technology for the new generation, with great solutions and capability, as the future of the Internet. The user will have more control of their data and switch around various social media, using a single personalized account, creating a public record on the blockchain of all the activity. The benefits of Web3 technology will easily be adaptable for an average person to use in their daily life, a boon to society, as the growth is exponential. It will be permissionless and truly democratic. All data will be interconnected in a decentralized way, unlike the current generation of the internet (Web 2.0), where data is mostly stored in cen",
    "tralized repositories. Web3 is close to becoming mainstream. The industry has emerged, centred around decentralized applications (dApps), built on blockchain technology, which could significantly impact daily lives for many people to happier computing, secured Data with greater control of their data and actions by replacing the current centralized monopolies(web2) and more intelligent Internet. Thus, paving a road to more safe, secure computing with Artificial intelligence techniques to mime human behaviour and Personalization driven. \n\n\nThe web3 space is a whole new playground for many more new innovations to come, it is a doorway to the unknown, I am very grateful for the time spent compiling this thesis, learning new topics addressing problems with a very precise and comprehensive resolution.

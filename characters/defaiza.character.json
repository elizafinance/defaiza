One of the key aspects of the process is keeping “running totals” of “things.” Examples of items a business might keep track of include the amount of cash the business currently has, what a company has paid for utilities for the month, the amount of money it owes, its income for the entire year, and the total cost of all the equipment it has purchased. You want to always have these running totals up to date so they are readily available to you when you need the information. It is similar to checki",
    "ng what your cash balance in the bank is when deciding if you have enough money to make a purchase with your debit card. We will now refer to these “running totals” as balances and these “things” as accounts. Any item that a business is interested in keeping track of in terms of a running dollar balance so it can determine “how much right now?” or “how much so far?” is set up as an account. There are five types, or categories, of accounts. \n\n**WHAT IS A CATEGORY?** \n\n A category is a classification that generally describes its contents. The table below shows three column headings in bold: Planets , Colors , and Food. These are sample categories. \n\n PLANETS COLORS FOOD Saturn Venus Mars Earth \n\n Red Green Yellow Blue \n\n Pizza Brownies Chicken Eggplant \n\n Below each column heading is a list of four items that are actual examples of items that fall into the respective category. If “Red” appeared under the “Planets” heading, you would immediately assume there was an error. It does not belo",
    "ng there. \n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ACCOUNTING CYCLE SERVICE CASH \n\nThere are many items that businesses keep records of. Each of these accounts \n\nfall into one of five **categories**. \n\n1. **Assets:** Anything of value that a business owns \n\n2. **Liabilities:** Debts that a business owes; claims on assets by outsiders \n\n3. **Stockholders’ equity:** Worth of the owners of a business; claims on     assets by the owners \n\n4. **Revenue:** Income that results when a business operates and generates     sales \n\n5. **Expenses:** Costs associated with earning revenue \n\nDifferent accounts fall into different categories. **Cash** is an account that falls \n\nin the **asset** category. The Cash account keeps track of the amount of money a \n\nbusiness has. Checks, money orders, and debit and credit cards are considered to \n\nbe cash. \n\nOther than _Cash_ , we will begin by covering accounts that fall into the **revenue** \n\nand **expense** categories. \n\n**Revenue** is income that results fro",
    "m a business engaging in the activities that \n\nit is set up to do. For example, a computer technician earns revenue when they \n\nrepairs a computer for a customer. If the same computer technician sells a van that \n\nthey no longer needs for his business, it is not considered revenue. \n\n**_Fees Earned_** is an account name commonly used to record income generated \n\nfrom providing a service. In a service business, customers buy expertise, advice, \n\naction, or an experience but do not purchase a physical product. Consultants, dry \n\ncleaners, airlines, attorneys, and repair shops are service-oriented businesses. The \n\n_Fees Earned_ account falls into the **revenue** category. \n\n**Expenses** are bills and other costs a business must pay in order for it to operate \n\nand earn revenue. As the adage goes, “It takes money to make money.” \n\n**Expense accounts** differ from business to business, depending on individual \n\ncompany needs. The following are some common expenses that many businesses \n\nha",
    "ve: \n\n Wages Expense Cost of paying hourly employees Rent Expense Cost for the use of property that belongs to someone else Utilities Expense Costs such as electricity, water, phone, gas, cable TV, etc. Supplies Expense Cost of small items used to run a business Insurance Expense Cost of protection from liability, damage, injury, theft, etc. Advertising Expense Cost of promoting the business Maintenance Expense Costs related to repair and upkeep Miscellaneous Expense Costs that are minor and/or non-repetitive ANY Expense Any cost associated with earning revenue \n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ACCOUNTING CYCLE SERVICE CASH \n\nA **chart of accounts** is a list of all accounts used by a business. Accounts are \n\npresented by category in the following order: (1) Assets, (2) Liabilities, (3) Stock\n\nholders’ equity, (4) Revenue, and (5) Expenses. \n\n**1.2 NET INCOME—A CRITICAL AMOUNT** \n\nThe difference between the total revenue and total expense amounts for a \n\nparticular period (such as ",
    "a month or year), assuming revenue is higher, is **profit.** \n\nWe will now refer to profit as **net income**. The following is a key calculation in \n\ndetermining a business’s operating results in dollars: \n\nRevenue Expenses = Net Income \n\nNet income is determined by subtracting all expenses for a month (or year) \n\nfrom all revenue for that same month (or year). A **net loss** results if total expenses \n\nfor a month (or year) exceed total revenue for the same period of time. \n\nNet income is a result that business people are extremely interested in knowing \n\nsince it represents the results of a firm’s operations in a given period of time. \n\n**1.3 THE MECHANICS OF THE ACCOUNTING PROCESS** \n\n**1.3.1 The Journal** \n\nFinancial statements are key goals of the accounting process. In order to \n\nprepare them at the end of an accounting period, individual financial transactions \n\nmust be analyzed, classified, and recorded all throughout the period. This initially \n\ntakes place in a record book ca",
    "lled the **journal** , where financial events called \n\n**transactions** are recorded as they happen, in chronological order. \n\n**CHART OF ACCOUNTS (PARTIAL)** \n\nThe following table summarizes the categories and accounts discussed so far: \n\n ASSETS REVENUE EXPENSES Cash Fees Earned Wages Expense Rent Expense Utilities Expense Supplies Expense Insurance Expense Advertising Expense Miscellaneous Expense \n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ACCOUNTING CYCLE SERVICE CASH \n\nWhen a transaction occurs, two or more accounts are affected. There is also a \n\ndollar amount associated with each of the accounts. Determining which accounts \n\nare impacted, and by how much, is the first step in making a journal entry. \n\nThis is a sample of a few rows in a journal. It has five columns: _Date, Account,_ \n\n_Post. Ref., Debit, Credit._ \n\n Date Account Debit Credit \n\nIn the journal, the column heading **Debit** means “left” and **Credit** means \n\n“right.” There are other familiar interpretations of these wo",
    "rds, so don’t be \n\nconfused: the terms here only have to do with whether a dollar amount is entered \n\nin the left or the right number column. \n\nThese words may also be used as verbs: To “debit an account” means to enter \n\nits amount in the left column. To “credit an account” means to enter its amount in \n\nthe right column. \n\n**1.3.2 Rules of Debit and Credit** \n\nWhether a particular account should be debited or credited is based on (1) the \n\ntype of account it is and (2) whether the account is increasing or decreasing. \n\n**1.3.3 Journalizing Transactions** \n\nWe now will come to one of the most important procedures in the recordkeeping \n\nprocess **: journal entries**. It involves analyzing and writing down financial \n\ntransactions in a record book called a **journal**. Financial events are evaluated and \n\ntranslated into the language of accounting using the process of **journalizing**. \n\nSelect two accounts and, according to the rules of debit and credit for cash, \n\nrevenue, and expense",
    " accounts, decide which account to debit (left column) and \n\nwhich to credit (right column). The debit entry is always listed first. No dollar signs \n\nare required in the journal. \n\n**RULES OF DEBIT AND CREDIT** \n\n**for** **_Cash_** **and Revenue and Expense accounts** \n\n Debit CASH when you receive it Cash increases Credit CASH when you pay it out Cash decreases Debit EXPENSES when you incur them Expenses increase Credit REVENUE when you earn it Revenue increases \n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ACCOUNTING CYCLE SERVICE CASH \n\n**Journalizing** involves the following steps: \n\n1. Select two (or more) accounts impacted by a transaction. \n\n2. Determine how much, in dollars, each account is affected. Often times     the amounts are given; other times the amounts must be calculated     based on the information provided. \n\n3. Based on the rules of debit and credit, decide which account(s) is     debited and which is credited. \n\n4. Enter the date on the first line of the transaction only",
    ". \n\n5. Enter the account that will be **debited** on the **first line** of the     transaction. Enter its amount in the Debit column on the same line. \n\n6. Enter the account that will be **credited** on the **second line** of the     transaction. Enter its amount in the Credit column on the same line.     NOTE: Indent the credit account name three spaces. \n\n**SAMPLE TRANSACTION #1:** \n\nOn 6/1, a company paid rent of $2,000 for the month of June. \n\n Date Account Debit Credit PARTIAL TRANSACTION 6/1 Rent Expense 2,000 ▲^ Rent Expense^ is an^ expense account that is increasing. Therefore, it is debited. The account with the debit amount is entered first. \n\n Date Account Debit Credit COMPLETE TRANSACTION \n\n 6/1 Rent Expense 2,000 ▼^ Cash^ is an^ asset^ account that is decreasing. Therefore, it is credited.

    "t Credit PARTIAL TRANSACTION \n\n 6/5 Cash 800 ▲^ Cash^ is an^ asset^ account that is increasing. Therefore, it is debited. The account with the debit amount is entered first. \n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ACCOUNTING CYCLE SERVICE CASH \n\n Date Account Debit Credit COMPLETE TRANSACTION 6/5 Cash 800 ▼^ Fees Earned^ is a^ revenue account that is increasing. Therefore, it is credited. The account with the credit amount is entered next. \n\n Fees Earned 800 \n\nIn practice, each transaction follows immediately after the previous one, as \n\nshown here. \n\n Date Account Debit Credit 6/1 Rent Expense 2,000 \n\n Cash 2,000 6/5 Cash 800 Fees Earned 800 6/8 Wages Expense 500 Cash 500 6/10 Cash 600 Fees Earned 600 \n\nThe same journal continues on from period to period. You do not start a new \n\njournal for a new accounting period (month or year). \n\n**1.3.4 Ledger** \n\nThe **ledger** is the second accounting record book that is a list of a company’s \n\nindividual accounts list in order of account categor",
    "y. While the journal lists all \n\ntypes of transactions chronologically, the ledgers separate this same information \n\nout by account and keep a running balance of each of these accounts. \n\nEach account has its own ledger page. The account name appears across the top. \n\nThe ledger form has six columns: _Date, Item, Debit, Credit, Debit, Credit._ The first \n\nset of Debit and Credit columns are where amounts from the journal transactions \n\nare **copied**. The second set of Debit and Credit columns are where the account’s \n\nrunning total is maintained. An account’s **running balance** typically appears in \n\neither the Debit or the Credit column, not both. \n\nThe following is a sample ledger for the Cash account. \n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ACCOUNTING CYCLE SERVICE CASH \n\n Cash Date Item Debit Credit Debit Credit 6/1 12,000 12,000 6/2 2,000 14,000 \n\n 6/3 3,000 11,000 \n\n Copy amounts from journal (use either column) \n\n BALANCE columns (use one of the two) \n\n**IMPORTANT:** Information",
    " entered in the ledger is always **copied** from what is \n\nalready in the journal. \n\n**1.3.5 Posting** \n\nThe process of copying from the journal to the ledger is called **posting**. It is \n\ndone one line at a time from the journal. Here are step-by-step instructions for \n\ndoing so. \n\n1. Take note of the account name in the first line of the journal. Find that     ledger account. \n\n2. Copy the date from the journal to the first blank row in that ledger. \n\n3. Leave the Item column blank in the ledger at this point. \n\n4. Take note of the amount on the first line of the journal and the     column it is in. \n\n5. Copy that amount to the same column in the ledger on the same     line where you entered the date. \n\n6. Update the account’s running balance. Take note of the previous     balance in the last two columns of the ledger, if there is one. Do one of     the following, based on the situation. \n\n a. If there is no previous balance and the entry is a Debit, enter the same amount in the Deb",
    "it balance column. \n\n b. If there is no previous balance and the entry is a Credit, enter the same amount in the Credit balance column. \n\n c. If the previous balance is in the Debit column and the entry is a Debit, add the two amounts and enter the total in the Debit balance column. \n\n d. If the previous balance is in the Debit column and the entry is a Credit, subtract the credit amount from the balance and enter the difference in the Debit balance column. * \n\ne. If the previous balance is in the Credit column and the entry is \n\n\n PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ACCOUNTING CYCLE SERVICE CASH \n\n a Credit, add the two amounts and enter the total in the Credit balance column. \n\n f. If the previous balance is in the Credit column and the entry is a Debit, subtract the debit amount from the balance and enter the difference in the Credit balance column. * \n\n * Note: The only exception to the above is the rare occasion when one of the calculations above results in a negative number. No ne",
    "gative amounts should appear in the ledgers. Instead, the balance will appear in the opposite balance column. \n\n7. Go back to the journal and enter an “x” or checkmark in the PR column     to indicate that you have posted that line item. \n\n8. Repeat the process for the next line in the journal. \n\n Every time an account appears on a line in the journal, its amount is copied to the proper column in that account’s ledger. A running total is maintained for each account and is updated every time an amount is posted. The example that follows shows a journal with five transactions that involve Cash. On each row where Cash appears in the journal, the amount on the same line is copied to the same column in the Cash ledger, in either the first Debit or the first Credit column. Superscripts are used here to match each Cash amount in the journal to its posting in the ledger. For example, the first debit to Cash in the journal for $6,000 is copied to the debit column in the ledger (#1). The next ti",

For the _Cash_ account, the first entry is in the first Debit column, so the \n\nrunning balance begins accumulating in the second Debit column. On the first row, \n\nthe amounts in the two Debit columns will be the same. In this c",
    "ase, the amount \n\nis $6,000 in both. After the first entry in the ledger, subsequent debit entries are \n\nadded to the previous debit balance, and subsequent credit entries are deducted \n\nfrom the previous debit balance. \n\n**1.3.6 Normal Balance** \n\nThe last two Debit and Credit columns in the ledger are where a running \n\ntotal (balance) is maintained for each account. An account’s running balance will \n\naccumulate in EITHER the Debit balance column OR Credit balance column (two \n\nfar right columns), but rarely both. The **normal balance** is also whatever it takes \n\nto increase that type of account, either Debit or Credit. The normal balance for an \n\naccount is the column in which its running total is maintained. \n\nAn example of a journal and ledgers follows. Try to follow how the numbers \n\nfrom the journal on the left appear in the ledgers on the right and how the running \n\nbalances in the ledgers are determined. \n\n**GETTING THE JOB DONE** \n\n You can go to an ATM to withdraw cash from",
    " your checking account. The first steps are to insert your debit card into the ATM machine and select the amount you would like to receive. If that is all you do, no money will come out no matter how long you stand there. In order to get the job done, you also need to enter your PIN. The goal is to withdraw cash, and if you do not complete that step, it is not going to happen. \n\n Similarly, there is a goal to preparing the journal and ledgers – to maintain a running balance of each account your business has. If you enter a transaction in the journal, you are off to a good start, but if you don’t complete the step of posting the journal entry to the ledgers, the correct balances are not going to happen. \n\n\n PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ACCOUNTING CYCLE SERVICE CASH \n\n**JOURNAL LEDGERS** \n\n Cash \n\n**Date Account Debit Credit Date Item Debit Credit Debit Credit** \n\n6/1 Cash x 2,000 6/1 2,000 2,000 \n\n Fees Earned x 2,000 6/2 300 1,700 \n\n6/2 Supplies Expense x 300 6/3 500 2,200 \n\n Cas",

If the first entry is a Debit, the running balance accumulates in the Debit balance column. A debit is the “positive” for this type of account; any subsequent debit entries are added and credit entries are subtracted from the running balance. Conversely, if the first entry is a Credit, the running balance accumulates in the Credit balance column. A credit is the “posit",
    "ive” for this type of account; any subsequent credit entries are added and debit entries are subtracted from the running balance. The grayed column above in each ledger represents the balance column that will normally remain blank. The total of all the Debit balances in the ledgers MUST EQUAL the total of all the Credit balances in the ledgers. If this is not the case, there is a recording error \n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ACCOUNTING CYCLE SERVICE CASH \n\nthat must be located and corrected. In the example above, the ledgers balance: \n\n3,000 + 900 (debit balances) = 3,900 (credit balance). \n\nThe same ledgers continue on from period to period. You do not start new \n\nledgers for a new accounting period (month or year). \n\nTo summarize the two record books, the journal first records all types of \n\ntransactions chronologically, in time sequence order. The ledgers separate the \n\nsame information out by account and keep a balance for each of these accounts. \n\n**IMPORTANT:** If you are",
    " making entries in the ledgers, you must be COPYING \n\nfrom the journal. \n\n**CAN I HAVE THE RECIPE?** \n\nI have a great recipe for chocolate chip cookies. Here are the ingredients \n\n At this point you must be confused, or think I am crazy. The cookies could not possibly be the result of those ingredients—the input does not match the output. Anyone who knows anything about cookies can see that. \n\n It is the same with the accounting process. It is not possible to have a correct ledger and/or financial statement balances if the input in the journal has errors. Yet some students “know,” or copy from others, what the correct results should be in spite of incorrect journal entries. This violates the process of posting to the ledgers, which is carrying over what is in the journal. \n\n It is more correct for an error to carry through to all parts than for one part to be incorrect and subsequent parts to be correct. To your accounting instructor, a correct balance based on a faulty journal is as u",

A trial balance is a list of all a business’s accounts and its current ledger balances (copied over from the ledger accounts). A trial balance may be generated at any time to test whether total debits equals total credits. It is simply a worksheet to check for accuracy before preparing financial statements. If b",
    "oth of the Total columns do not equal, there is an error that must be found and corrected. The example that follows is for a company with only four accounts. The trial balance on the left lists these accounts and their corresponding balances at the end of the month, which are copied over from the ledgers on the right. \n\n TRIAL BALANCE June 30, 2018 Account Debit Credit Cash 3,000 Common Stock 2,000 Fees Earned 1,900 Supplies Expense 900 \n\n TOTAL 3,900 3,900 \n\n LEDGERS Cash Fees Earned \n\n Date Item Debit Credit Debit Credit Date Item Debit Credit Debit Credit \n\n6/1 2,000 2,000 6/3 500 500 \n\n6/2 300 1,700 6/5 800 1,300 \n\n6/3 500 2,200 6/7 600 1,900 \n\n6/4 200 2,000 \n\n6/5 800 2,800 \n\n6/6 400 2,400 **Supplies Expense** \n\n6/7 600 3,000 **Date Item Debit Credit Debit Credit** \n\n 6/2 300 300 \n\n 6/4 200 500 Common Stock 6/6 400 900 \n\n**Date Item Debit Credit Debit Credit** \n\n6/1 2,000 2,000 \n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ACCOUNTING CYCLE SERVICE CASH \n\n**1.4 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** \n\nThe ",
    "goal of journalizing, posting to the ledgers, and preparing the trial balance \n\nis to gather the information necessary to produce the **financial statements**. The \n\n**time period** concept requires companies produce the financial statements on a \n\nregular basis over the same time interval, such as a month or year. Most of the \n\namounts on these statements are copied directly from the trial balance, and then \n\nappropriate calculations and summary amounts are also displayed. The first of the \n\nfour financial statements will be discussed here. \n\n**1.4.1 Income Statement** \n\nThe **net income** from a business’s operations for a period of time is so \n\nimportant to business people and investors that one financial statement—the income \n\nstatement—is dedicated to showing what that amount is and how it was determined. \n\nThe **income statement** is a report that lists and summarizes revenue, expense, \n\nand net income information for a period of time, usually a month or a year. It is \n\nbased on ",
    "the following equation: **Revenue Expenses = Net income** (or Net \n\nloss). Revenue is shown first; a list of expenses follows, and their total is subtracted \n\nfrom revenue. If the difference is positive, there is a profit, or net income. If the \n\ndifference is negative, there is a net loss that is typically presented in parentheses \n\nas a negative number. \n\nThe income statement answers a business’s most important question: _How_ \n\n_much profit is it making?_ It is limited to a specific **period of time** (month or year) \n\nfrom beginning to end. The income statement relies on the **matching principle** \n\nin that it only reports revenue and expenses in a specified window of time. \n\nIt does not include any revenue or expenses from before or after that block of time. \n\n**SAMPLE INCOME STATEMENT FORMATTING TIPS** \n\n Complete heading: Company Name, Name of Financial Statement, Date \n\n Two Columns of numbers—left one for listing items to be sub-totaled; right one for results \n\n Dollar signs g",

We will hold off for now on the other three financial statements— \n\nthe retained earnings statement, the balance sheet, and the statement of cash flows \n\n—and learn about those later. \n\n**1.4.2 The Accounting Cycle** \n\nAccounting is practiced under a guideline called the time period assumption, \n\nwhich allows the ongoing activities of a",
    " business to be divided up into periods of a \n\nyear, quarter, month, or other increment of time. The precise time period covered is \n\nincluded in the headings of the income statement, the retained earnings statement, \n\nand the statement of cash flows. \n\nTherefore, the accounting process is cyclical. A cycle is a period of time in which \n\na series of accounting activities are performed. As was just stated, the typical \n\naccounting cycle is a year, a month, or perhaps a quarter. Once the current cycle is \n\ncompleted, the same recording and reporting activities are then repeated in the \n\nnext period of time of equal length. \n\n#### \u001f \n\n#### \u001e \n\n#### \u001d \n\n#### \u001c \n\n A cycle can be thought of as a repetitive sequence of procedures. Think about the cycle of attending college. Each semester, you register for classes; receive syllabi on the first day of classes; take tests, write papers, and prepare projects; complete final exams; and receive course grades. The following semester, you repeat the ",
    "same steps toward the completion of your degree. \n\n Although your instructors, course content, and grades may be different each semester, the steps in the cycle are very similar. \n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ACCOUNTING CYCLE SERVICE CASH \n\nIn accounting, journalizing and posting transactions to the ledgers are done \n\nevery day in the cycle. Financial statements are typically prepared only on the last \n\nday of the cycle. Once the financial statements are complete, the process continues \n\non into the next accounting period, where again the financial statements are the \n\ngoal of the recordkeeping process. \n\n**1.4.3 Temporary Accounts** \n\nThe accounts on the income statement are called **temporary** accounts. They \n\nare used to record operational transactions for a specific period of time. Once the \n\nincome statement is prepared to report the temporary account balances at the end \n\nof the period, these account balances are set back to zero by transferring them to \n\nanother account",
    ". When the next accounting period begins, the beginning balances \n\nof the temporary accounts are zero, for a fresh start. \n\n**1.4.4 Closing Entries** \n\nThe financial statements are the goal of all that is done in the accounting cycle. \n\nHowever, there are some steps that need to be taken once those reports are completed \n\nto set up the ledgers for the next cycle. These steps involve closing entries. \n\nClosing entries are special journal entries made at the end of the accounting \n\nperiod (month or year) **after the financial statements are prepared** but before \n\nthe first transaction in the next month is recorded in the journal. The purpose of \n\nclosing entries is to set the balances of income statement accounts back to zero so \n\nyou can start fresh and begin accumulating new balances for the next month. This \n\nprocess ensures that the balances on the second month’s income statement do not \n\ninclude amounts from transactions in the first month. \n\nProfit at the end of the accounting per",
    "iod is transferred into a new account \n\ncalled **Retained Earnings** when the revenue and expense accounts are closed \n\nout. The Retained Earnings account is only used for closing entries. \n\nClosing entries transfer the balances from the revenue and expense accounts \n\ninto _Retained Earnings_ in preparation for the new month_. Retained Earnings_ \n\nis an account where profit is “stored.” Think of the retained earnings balance as \n\n“accumulated profit,” or all the net income that the business has ever generated \n\nsince it began operations. \n\nAssume a business’s accounting period is a month. For the first month in which \n\nthe business operates, the beginning retained earnings balance is zero since there \n\nwere no previous periods and therefore no previous profits. At the end of the first \n\nmonth, the retained earnings balance equals the net income for the month. \n\nAfter the first month, when closing entries for the current month are journalized \n\nand posted, the additional net income for ",
    "the next month is added to any net income \n\nalready in _Retained Earnings_ from previous months. Since **Revenue Expenses** \n\n**= Net Income** , moving revenue and expense balances into _Retained Earnings_ is \n\nthe same as moving the net income. \n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ACCOUNTING CYCLE SERVICE CASH \n\nThe _Retained Earnings_ account is not closed out; instead, revenue and expense \n\naccounts are closed out into it. The effects are that the credit balance in _Retained_ \n\n_Earnings_ increases each month by the month’s net income amount, and the \n\nbalances of _Fees Earned_ and all the expense accounts become zero. \n\nClosing entries are entered in the same journal that was used for the general \n\nentries during the month. The first closing entry is journalized right after the last \n\ngeneral entry. Closing entries must be posted to the ledgers to impact the revenue, \n\nexpense, and _Retained Earnings_ account balances. \n\nAs an example, assume that on 6/30 _Fees Earned_ has a credi",
    "t ledger balance of \n\n$2,100 and _Rent Expense_ (the only expense account) has a debit ledger balance of \n\n$500. Net income is therefore $1,600. The closing entry process would be as follows: \n\n1. **Zero out the Fees Earned account** (and any other revenue accounts, if \n\n there are others.) Debit Fees Earned for its credit balance of $2,100 to close it out and bring its balance to zero. \n\n**RUNNING IN CIRCLES** \n\n A track star is practicing running a lap at a time around the track. He has a timekeeper with a stopwatch timing each lap. The timekeeper clicks “Start” and the runner takes off. He crosses the finish line in 50 seconds, the time elapsed as shown on the stopwatch when “Stop” was clicked. \n\n The runner rests, drinks, and decides to try again to see if he can do better. The timekeeper clicks “Start” and the runner takes off, running even faster. He crosses the finish line in 95 seconds, the time elapsed as shown on the stopwatch when “Stop” was clicked. \n\n What is wrong with th",
    "is picture? Was he so much slower? He did not have a poor sprint; he had a poor timekeeper! This person did not reset the stopwatch to zero for the second run, so the 50 seconds from the first run was included with the 45 seconds from the second run. The runner can subtract the 50 from the 95, but who wants to do math on the track? That is what the reset button is for, and it enables the results of both runs to be easily compared. \n\n Similarly, income statements include revenue and expense amounts for a period of time—a month or a year. After one month is reported, the ledger balances of these accounts must be reset to zero so that the next month’s income statement does not include amounts from the previous month. This is done by closing out the revenue and expense ledger balances and resetting their balances to zero. \n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ACCOUNTING CYCLE SERVICE CASH \n\nCredit Retained Earnings for the same amount. \n\n**Date Account Debit Credit** (^) ▼ _Fees Earned_ is",
    " a **revenue** account 6/30 Fees Earned 2,100 that is **decreasing**. Retained Earnings 2,100 (^) ▲ _Retained Earnings_ is an **equity** account that is **increasing**. \n\n2. **Zero out the Rent Expense account** (and any other expense accounts, if \n\n there are others.) Credit Rent Expense for its debit balance of $500 to close it out and bring the balance to zero. Debit Retained Earnings for the same amount. \n\n**Date Account Debit Credit** (^) ▼ _Retained Earnings_ is an **equity** 6/30 Retained Earnings 500 account that is **decreasing**. Rent Expense (^500) ▼ _Rent Expense_ is an **expense** account that is **decreasing**. Once posted, these two closing entries above increase the Retained Earnings balance by $1,600, which is $2,100 $500. The balances in Fees Earned and Rent Expense are now both zero. **EXAMPLE One month to the next WITHOUT closing entries on 6/30** The following journal shows five June transactions. (There would be more, but we will just use five for the example.) Th",
    "ese are posted to the ledgers on the right. The running balance in Fees Earned as of 6/30 is a $2,100 credit. The running balances of Rent Expense and Wages Expense as of 6/30 are a $500 debit and a $300 debit, respectively. These three amounts would be reported on the income statement in arriving at a net income of $1,300 for June. Then July begins and the journal also shows the first three July transactions. Once again Rent Expense on the first of the month is $500, the first Fees Earned transaction is $900, and Wages Expense is $300. Both amounts are posted to their respective ledgers, as is shown in the following example. \n\n\n PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ACCOUNTING CYCLE SERVICE CASH \n\n**JOURNAL LEDGERS (EXCEPT CASH)** \n\n Retained Earnings Date Account Debit Credit Date Item Debit Credit Debit Credit \n\n6/1 Rent Expense x 500 \n\n Cash x 500 \n\n6/5 Cash x 600 \n\n Fees Earned x 600 Fees Earned \n\n6/8 Wages Expense x 300 **Date Item Debit Credit Debit Credit** \n\n Cash x 300 6/5 600 6",

When the 7/1 Rent Expense debit is posted, the running balance becomes $1,000. According to procedure, that final balance would be copied to July’s income statement. That report would indicate that it cost the company $1,000 in rent during July, which is clearly not true. It only cost $500 for rent in July. The problem is that the $500 in June became a part of the July running total. The same issue is true for Fees Earned. Only $900 was earned in July so far as of 7/2, but the running balance is showing $3,000. That",
    " is because the running total to date in July also includes the $2,100 that was earned in June. The matching principle in accounting states that the revenue earned in a period must be reported in conjunction with the expenses incurred in that same period. The period we are now referring to is the month of July in this example. However, June’s revenues and expenses are still included in the balances in the ledgers. Closing entries on 6/30 here would have avoided this situation but were omitted, so the July balances erroneously contain amounts from June as well. \n\n\n PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ACCOUNTING CYCLE SERVICE CASH \n\n**EXAMPLE** \n\n**One month to the next WITH closing entries on 6/30** \n\n The following journal has similar transactions to the previous example PLUS it has the necessary closing entries in red for the three income statement accounts. It also shows how posting the closing entries impact the ledger account balances: revenue and expense balances are now zero on 6/",
    "30, and the Retained Earnings balance has increased from zero. Closing entries are shown in red in the following example. It is a good idea to enter the word “Closing” in the Item column in the ledgers to indicate that a closing entry has been posted. \n\n**JOURNAL LEDGERS (EXCEPT CASH)** \n\n Retained Earnings Date Account Debit Credit Date Item Debit Credit Debit Credit \n\n6/1 Rent Expense x 500 6/30 Closing 2,100 2,100 \n\n Cash x 500 6/30 Closing 500 1,600 \n\n6/5 Cash x 600 6/30 Closing 300 1,300 \n\n Fees Earned x 600 \n\n6/8 Wages Expense x 300 \n\n Cash x 300 Fees Earned \n\n6/20 Cash x 700 **Date Item Debit Credit Debit Credit** \n\n Fees Earned x 700 6/5 600 600 \n\n6/29 Cash x 800 6/20 700 1,300 \n\n Fees Earned x 800 6/29 800 2,100 \n\n6/30 Fees Earned x 2,100 6/30 Closing 2,100 0 \n\n Retained Earnings x 2,100 7/2 900 900 \n\n6/30 Retained Earnings x 500 \n\n Rent Expense x 500 \n\n6/30 Retained Earnings x 300 **Rent Expense** \n\n Wages Expense x 300 Date Item Debit Credit Debit Credit \n\n7/1 Rent Expense x",

When the first July transaction is recorded in these accounts, it becomes the beginning balance for the new accounting period. By doing this, the income statement for June reports only June transactions, and the income statement for July reports only July transactions. The income statements for the two months can then easily be compared.

The company provided the service, and the customer paid cash in full for th",
    "at service. A second possibility involves the business sending a bill, or invoice, to the customer and typically giving the customer thirty days to pay. This is a revenue transaction **on account**. \n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ACCOUNTING CYCLE SERVICE CASH \n\nThe business records earnings and credits Fees Earned when it provides the \n\nservice, regardless of when it receives the payment. When Fees Earned is credited \n\nbecause revenue is earned, there are now two possible debit accounts: Cash (paid \n\non the spot), or **Accounts Receivable** (to be paid in the future). \n\nAccounts Receivable is an asset account that keeps track of how much customers \n\nowe because a business sent invoices for goods or services to the customers rather \n\nthan immediately receiving cash from them. This account is used as a substitute \n\nfor a debit to Cash when a company provides services to customers and bills them \n\non account rather than receiving cash right away. \n\nWhen the customer pays the invoic",

    "\n\n**1.5.1 Assets** \n\n Assets are anything of value to a business, including things a business owns so it can operate. Assets are recorded in the journal at what they cost the business, or what the business paid to acquire them. This is called the cost principle. The first two asset accounts are those you are familiar with so far. These are current assets , which means they are either cash or are expected to be converted to cash within one year. \n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ACCOUNTING CYCLE SERVICE CASH \n\nCash Money a business possesses \n\n Accounts Receivable Amount customers owe to a business from being invoiced on account \n\nThe following assets are **fixed assets**.

The people and/or organizations who own a corporation are called \n\n**stockholders**. Stockholders (owners) receive shares of stock as receipts for their \n\ninvestments in the business. This form of business offers **limited liability** to \n\nstockholders—the owners can only lose what they invested in the business. Their \n\nother assets cannot be taken to satisfy the obligations of the company they invest in. \n\nThe following are stockholders’ equity accounts: \n\n C",

If you do not incorporate, your business is a sole proprietorship. If you do incorporate, your business is a corporation. To form a corporation, a business needs to file paperwork called articles of incorporation (and pay a fee) with the state in which it will be operating. The state grants the business its corporate status. \n\n If you damage the property of one of your customers and he submits a claim against you for $10,000, the most that you can be liable for as a corporation is the amount you have invested and earned in the business. As a sole proprietorship, ho",
    "wever, it is possible the customer can be awarded more than the value of your ownership in the business. You would then have to pay out the difference using your personal money. If you don’t have enough, you could even be forced to sell some of the things you own or make payments from your future wages to pay the claim off. If you are not organized as a corporation, your risk is not limited to the amount you invested and earned in the business. \n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ACCOUNTING CYCLE SERVICE CASH \n\nStockholders’ equity is the amount of a business’s total assets that is owned by \n\nthe stockholders. Only two accounts fall in this category: stockholders’ equity is the \n\ntotal of the balances in the Common Stock and Retained Earnings accounts. \n\nCommon stock is the ownership value in the business that comes from outside \n\nthe company—investors who pay their own money into the business. Retained \n\nearnings is the ownership value in the business that comes from inside the \n\nco",

Cash \n\ndividends will reduce the _Retained Earnings_ balance. This is ultimately accom\n\nplished by closing the _Cash Dividends_ balance into _Retained Earnings_ at the end \n\nof the accounting period. \n\n**1.5.4 Balance Sheet Account Transactions** \n\nSix very typical business transactions that involve balance sheet accounts will \n\nbe shown next. \n\n1.

The company pays a down \n\npayment of $1,000 and takes a loan for the remaining $4,000. \n\n Date Account Debit Credit ▲ Equipment is an asset account that is increasing. ▼ Cash is an asset account that is decreasing. ▲ Note Payable is a liability account that is increasing. \n\n 6/1 Equipment 5,000 \n\n Cash 1,000 Note Payable 4,000 \n\nNOTE: Transaction #3 is called a compound transaction because there is more \n\nthan one credit. (A compound ",
    "transaction could also have more than one debit, \n\nif required.) **The total of the debits must equal the total of the credits in** \n\n**each transaction.** In this case one asset is being purchased, but there are two \n\nforms of payment—cash and the loan. \n\nAlso notice that in transactions #1, 2, and 3 above, the account debited is \n\n**Equipment** , an asset (and not **Equipment Expense** , which would be an expense \n\naccount). The same holds true for the purchase of real estate: the assets **Building** \n\nand/or **Land** would be debited (not **Building Expense** or **Land Expense** ). This \n\nis because these assets will last more than one accounting period. \n\nUsually one of the first steps in starting a business is opening the business’s \n\nbank account. \n\n4. An individual invests $10,000 of his own cash to open a new corporation’s \n\nchecking account. \n\n**Date Account Debit Credit** (^) ▲ _Cash_ is an **asset** account that is 6/1 Cash 10,000 **increasing**.

It recognizes that person’s ownership. A running total of all the investments that people make in a corporation is maintained in the **Common Stock** account. Transaction #4 is recorded when an investor puts money or other assets into a corporation. There are also times when investors take money out of a business. This can only be done if the corporation has generated a profit over time, which is what the investors will draw from. The accumulated profit over time appears in the corporation’s **Retained Earnings** account. The board of directors of large corporations or the owner(s) of small, closelyheld corporations may decide to pay cash dividends to stockholders if there are sufficient retained earnings and sufficient cash to do so. Cash dividends are payouts \n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ACCOUNTING CYCLE SERVICE CAS",
    "H \n\nof profit to stockholders; in other words, distributions of retained earnings. Cash \n\ndividends are not paid out of owner investments, or common stock. \n\n5. The corporation pays $1,000 in dividends to its stockholders. \n\nIt might seem logical to debit **Retained Earnings** to reduce that stockholders’ \n\nequity account and credit **Cash** to reduce that asset account. That is not entirely \n\nwrong. However, we are going to reserve **Retained Earnings** for closing \n\nentries only, and payment of dividends is not a closing entry. Instead of a debit to \n\n**Retained Earnings** , therefore, we will substitute the **Cash Dividends** account \n\nin this transaction. \n\n**Date Account Debit Credit** (^) ▲ _Cash Dividends_ is a **contra equity** 6/15 Cash Dividends 1,000 account that is **increasing**.

    "od (in this case a month), there is \n\none final closing entry in addition to the ones you already know for revenue and \n\nexpense accounts. This closes the Cash Dividends account to Retained Earnings, \n\nso ultimately the Retained Earnings account is reduced by the profit paid out to \n\nstockholders. The Cash Dividends account balance is set back to zero as a result. \n\n**Date Account Debit Credit** (^) ▼ _Retained Earnings_ is an **equity** 6/30 Retained Earnings 1,000 account that is **decreasing**.

The following summarizes the two cash dividends transactions in #5 and #6— paying the dividends and closing the **Cash Dividends** account at the end of the month. If the debit and credit to **Cash Dividends** is struck through since the two combined would result in a balance of zero in the **Cash Dividends** account, you are ultimately left with a debit to **Retained Earnings** (reducing it) and a cr",

Asset, Liability, and Stockholders’ Equity are accounts that appear on the balance sheet. Revenue and Expense are accounts reported on the income statement. There is a hybrid version of these account types called contra accounts. The normal balance of a contra account is intentionally the opposite of the normal balance for a particular account classification. For example, a contra asset account has a credit balance instead of the normal debit balance for an asset account. A contra revenue account has a debit balance instead of the normal",
    " credit balance for a revenue account. This allows a company to continue to report an original amount by not making any changes directly to an account. Instead, an alternative contra account is used to report any changes. The original account and its contra account(s) are presented together on the financial statements to show original amount, total amount of changes, and the net result of the two (which is called carrying or net amount). To recap, here is a list of the seven steps in the accounting cycle that we have covered to this point. Assume here that financial statements will be prepared at the end of each month. \n\n ACTION WHEN YOUR JOB \n\n1. Journalize transactions Daily THINK; analyze transactions \n\n2.

For the seven steps in the accounting cycle discussed so far, five of them primarily involve only copying and/or calculating. \n\n\n PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ACCOUNTING CYCLE SERVICE CASH \n\n THINKING is involved when making journal entries—you have to analyze what is happening and translate the transaction into accounting language by selecting accounts to debit and credit. You often have to calculate amounts as well. This is involved in steps #1 and #6. However, closing entries are the same three every time, so they should become relatively routine. The following table summarizes the rules of debit and credit and other facts about the accounts that you know so far: ",

It provides the foundation for the rules of debit and credit in the journalizing process, where for each tr",
    "ansaction total debits must equal total credits. As a result, the accounting equation must be in balance at all times for a business’ financial records to be correct. It involves the three types of accounts that do not appear on the income statement. **Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders’ Equity** Businesses own assets. These may be partially owned by the owners (stockholders) and partially owned by outsiders (debtors). \n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ACCOUNTING CYCLE SERVICE CASH \n\nWhen you purchase an asset, there are two ways to pay for it—with your own \n\nmoney and with other people’s money. This concept is a simple description of the \n\naccounting equation. \n\n**BUYING A TRUCK** \n\n When you buy a truck, you can pay cash for it, as shown in the following journal entry: \n\n Date Account Debit Credit 1/1 Truck 30,000 Cash 30,000 \n\nIf you pay in full, you own the entire vehicle and receive title to it. \n\n Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders’ Equity 30,000 = 0 + 30,000 \n\n As an alter",
    "native, you may purchase the truck by making a down payment for part of its cost and taking out a loan for the remainder. This is summarized by the following journal entry. \n\n Date Account Debit Credit 1/1 Truck 30,000 Cash 30,000 Note Payable 20,000 \n\n Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders’ Equity 30,000 = 20,000 + 10,000 \n\n This second scenario is a good illustration of the accounting equation using just one asset. The buyer receives the entire asset – the truck. The buyer must pay for this asset. They do so with two forms of payment: their own money (equity) and other people’s money (the loan). The combined total of their down payment and the loan equal the cost of the truck. \n\n The asset is the truck, the liability is the loan, and the down payment is the owner’s equity. \n\n\n PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ACCOUNTING CYCLE SERVICE CASH \n\n**1.7.1 Accounting Equation Broken Out** \n\n Indirectly, revenue and expense accounts are part of this accounting equation since they impact the v",
    "alue of stockholders’ equity by affecting the value of Retained Earnings. The Retained Earnings account normally has a credit balance. Closing entries move the credit balances of revenue accounts into Retained Earnings and cause that account to increase. Closing entries also transfer the debit balances of expense accounts into Retained Earnings , causing it to decrease. \n\n_Common Stock_ plus _Retained Earnings_ equals total stockholders’ equity. \n\n**1.7.2 Accounting Transaction Grid** \n\n The following grid illustrates how familiar transactions for a new business fit into the accounting equation: ASSETS = LIABILITIES + STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY. \n\n Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders’ Equity Revenue Expenses \n\n Cash \n\n Accounts Receivable = \n\n Accounts Payable + \n\n Common Stock \n\n Retained Earnings \n\n Fees Earned \n\n Rent Expense \n\n Supplies Expense \n\nIssued stock for cash, $1,000 1,000 1,000 \n\nPaid cash for rent, $700 (700) (700) \n\nSold to customers for cash, $900 900 900 \n\nPurchased supplie",

For the asset, liability, and stockholders’ equity amounts, positive numbers represent increases and negative amounts indicate decreases. The ending balances prove that total assets of $1,900 (1,500 + 400) equal total liabilities and stockholders’ equity of $1,900 (100 +1,000 + 800). \n\n**EXPANDED ACCOUNTING EQUATION** \n\n Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders’ Equity / \\ Common Stock Retained Earnings / \\ Revenue Expenses \n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ACCOUNTING CYCLE SERVICE CASH \n\nRevenue and expense accounts were used temporarily and were ultim",
    "ately \n\nclosed to Retained Earnings. As a result, the income statement account balances \n\nwere set to zero and the Retained Earnings balance increased by the net income \n\namount of $800. \n\n**1.7.3 Retained Earnings Statement** \n\nThe retained earnings statement is a report that shows the change in the \n\n**Retained Earnings** account balance from the beginning of the month to the end \n\nof the month due to net income (or loss) and any cash dividends declared during \n\nthe accounting period. \n\n Sample Retained Earnings Statement \n\n1. Start with Retained Earnings balance at     the beginning of the month. \n\n2. Add net income form the current month’s     income statement. \n\n3. Subtract from net income any dividends     declared during the month. \n\n4. End with new Retained Earnings balance     at the end of the month. \n\nProfit is such an important concept in business that two financial statements \n\nare devoted to talking about it. The income statement reports net income for one \n\nperiod, such ",
    "as a month or a year. The retained earnings statement deals with a \n\ncompany’s net income over the entire life of the business. \n\nThe retained earnings statement is a bridge between the income statement and \n\nthe balance sheet. The net income amount that appears on the retained earnings \n\nstatement comes from the income statement ($13,000 in the sample above). The \n\nending retained earnings balance ($40,000 in the sample above) feeds to the \n\nstockholders’ equity section of the balance sheet. \n\n**BALANCING YOUR BANK STATEMENT** \n\n The retained earnings statement includes elements similar to those in a monthly bank statement Both statements report a beginning balance, additions, subtractions, and an ending balance. \n\n Bank Statement (tracks your cash) \n\n Retained Earnings Statement (tracks a corporation’s accumulated profit) Balance at the beginning of the month Deposits Withdrawls Balance at the end of the month \n\n Balance at the beginning of the month Net Income Dividends Balance at t",

It is the culmination of all the financial information about the business—everything else done in the accounting cycle leads up to it. The balance sheet is an expanded version of the accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders’ Equity. The balance sheet lists and summarizes asset, liability, and stockholders’ equity accounts and their ledger balances as of a point in time. Assets are listed first. Liabilities and stockholders’ equity accounts follow, and these amounts are added together.

First, the income statement shows net income for the month. Next, the statement of retained earnings shows the beginning and ending Retained Earnings balances and the reason",
    "s for any change in this balance. Finally, the balance sheet presents asset, liability, and stockholders’ equity account balances. \n\n #1 The income statement is prepared first. It summarizes revenue and expenses for the month. Amounts come from the ledger balances. The result is either net income or net loss. \n\n Jonick Company Income Statement For the Month Ended June 30, 2018 \n\n Fees Earned $30,000 \n\n Operating Expenses: Salaries expense $2,500 Wages expense 2,200 Rent expense 2,000 Insurance expense 1,900 Supplies expense 1,800 Advertising expense 1,700 Maintenance expense 1,600 Utilities expense 1,400 Vehicle expense 1,100 Miscellaneous expense 800 Total operation expenses 17,000 Net Income 13,000 \n\n #2 The retained earnings statement is next. It adjusts the month’s beginning retained earnings balance by adding net income from the income statement and subtracting out dividends declared. The net income of $13,000 comes from the income statement. The result is a new retained earnings ",

It decreases due to a net loss or dividend payouts. Retained earnings \n\nincreases when revenue accounts are closed out into it and decreases when expense \n\naccounts and cash dividends are closed out into it. \n\nThe following examples illustrate journal entries that can cause stockholders’ \n\nequity to change. \n\n1.

My husband is an expert at this and was in the passenger seat as my instructor. In spite of the fact that he knew how to shift and clutch, and that he was telling me (rather loudly) what to do, I still rolled backward down a hill and over a motorcycle. I can drive a stick shift perfectly fine now, but it took lots of practice and stalling to get the feel of the process. \n\n Accounting is a skills discipline; it is also something you learn by doing. Your instructor may be an expert who explains and demonstrates, but you will only truly understand the process with hands-on practice. You have to learn it by doing it to get the feel of the process. That is how you will become an expert yourself. \n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ACCOUNTING CYCLE SERVICE CASH \n\n**1.9 WRAP UP** \n\nTo this point",
    ", you have been introduced to basic concepts that pertain to \n\nbusiness and to accounting. You have learned that businesses experience financial \n\ntransactions that are recorded by selecting accounts and amounts to represent these \n\nevents and entering them in the journal in chronological order. Journal entries \n\nare then copied to the ledgers to reorganize the same information by account. \n\n**One of the key aspects of the process is maintaining current running** \n\n**balances in all of the ledger accounts.** Account balances are then transferred \n\nto the income statement, retained earnings statement, and balance sheet for a \n\nprofessional, well-structured summary presentation that is meaningful to those \n\nreading the reports. Finally, the temporary revenue, expense, and dividends \n\naccounts are closed to _Retained Earnings_ at the end of the accounting period to \n\nset their balances back to zero so that the cycle can begin again. \n\n\n# 2 \n\n**Accounting Cycle for the Service** \n\n**Busine",
    "ss—Accrual Basis** \n\n**2.1 ACCRUAL BASIS OF ACCOUNTING** \n\n The accrual basis of accounting recognizes economic events when they take place, regardless of when the related cash transactions occur. Revenue is reported in the period in which you earn it, regardless of whether you received the cash for these services yet. Similarly, expenses are reported in the period in which you incur them to produce revenues, whether or not you have paid for these costs yet. \n\n**2.2 MATCHING PRINCIPLE** \n\n The matching principle relates to income statement accounts. It states that expenses incurred during a period should relate to (or match up with) the revenues earned during the same period. This lets you know how much it cost you to produce the revenue you generated in a given period of time, such as a month. \n\n**EXAMPLE** \n\n I hire you to mow my yard this afternoon and agree to pay you $50. I am not at home when you finish the job, so you leave me a bill in the mailbox. You have EARNED $50 today, ev",
    "en though you have not received the cash payment yet, because you completed the work. \n\n**ANALOGY** \n\n You have probably heard that “It takes money to make money.” A business person contributes financial resources and hopefully uses them effectively to generate even more value. The matching principle looks at a window of time in terms of how much income came in and how much it cost to generate that income. The key here is the “window of time,” such as a month. It compares how much came in in sales in a month vs. how much was spent. Any revenue or expenses before that month or after that month are not considered. \n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ACCOUNTING CYCLE SERVICE ACCRUAL \n\nBelow is Timeline #1, which includes three months. The red bars represent \n\nrevenue—three different jobs for $100 each. Job 1 was started in May and \n\ncompleted in June. Job 2 was started in June and completed in June. Job 3 was \n\nstarted in June and was completed in July. There was a total of $300 in reve",
    "nue \n\nfrom these three jobs, but not all of it is earned in June. As you can see, only half of \n\nthe revenue from Jobs 1 and 3 was earned in June. \n\nThe blue bars represent expenses. Expense 4 began in May and was incurred \n\npartially in May and partially in June. Expense 5 began in June and all of this \n\nexpense was incurred in June. Expense 6 also began in June; some of it was \n\nincurred in June and some in July. There was a total of $180 of expenses, but not \n\nall of it was incurred in June. As you can see, only half of the expenses from Jobs 1 \n\nand 3 was incurred in June. \n\n TIMELINE #1 2 $100 \n\n 1 $100 3 $100 \n\n May June July \n\n 4 $60 6 $60 \n\n 5 $60 \n\nLet’s say we want to produce an income statement for June, our window of \n\ntime. We want to include all the revenue and expenses that occurred in June, but none \n\nthat occurred in May or July. We have to “chop off” the pieces of these transactions \n\nthat did not occur in June to be left with only the parts that belong in June. \n\nThe",
    " result appears in the Timeline #2 below. In June, $200 of revenue ($50 + \n\n$100 + $50) was earned and is matched with $120 ($30 + $60 +$30) of expenses \n\nthat were incurred in the same month. The net income for June, therefore, was \n\n$80 ($200 $120). \n\n TIMELINE #2 2 $100 \n\n 1 $50 3 $50 \n\n May June July \n\n 4 $30 6 $30 \n\n 5 $60 \n\n\n PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ACCOUNTING CYCLE SERVICE ACCRUAL \n\n Adjusting entries, discussed next, help do the job of matching the June revenue with the June expenses by “chopping” off amounts of transactions that do not belong in a given month. \n\n**2.2.1 Adjusting Entries** \n\n Adjusting entries are special entries made just before financial statements are prepared—at the end of the month and/or year. They bring the balances of certain accounts up to date if they are not already current to properly match revenues and expenses. So far we have dealt with companies that did not need adjusting entries under the cash basis of accounting. Now we will see si",
    "tuations where they are necessary and will be using the accrual basis of accounting. Many ledger account balances are already correct at the end of the accounting period; however, some account balances may have changed during the period and but have not yet been updated. This is what you will do by making adjusting entries, and this will ensure that your financial statement numbers are current and correct. Adjusting entries are typically necessary for transactions that extend over more than one accounting period—you want to include the part of the transaction that belongs in the one accounting period you are preparing financial statements for and exclude that part that belongs in a previous or future accounting period. This relates to the matching process. \n\n IMPORTANT: Each adjusting entry will always affect at least one income statement account (revenue or expense) and one balance sheet account (asset or liability). \n\n**2.2.2 Complete Accounting Cycle** \n\n Accounting is a cyclical pr",
    "ocess. It involves a series of steps that take place in a particular order during a period of time. Once this period of time is over, these same steps are repeated in the next period of time of equal length. The complete accounting cycle involves these nine steps, done in this order: \n\n ACTION WHEN YOUR JOB \n\n1. Journalize transactions Daily THINK \n\n2.

Deferrals \n\nmay be either deferred expenses or deferred revenue. Accruals may be either \n\naccrued expenses or accrued revenue. \n\n1. Deferred expenses \n\n2. Deferred revenue \n\n3. Accrued expenses \n\n4. Accrued revenue \n\n**2.3.1 Adjusting Entries—Deferrals** \n\nDeferrals are adjusting entries that update a previous transaction. The first \n\njournal entry is a general one; the journal entry that updates an a",
    "ccount in this \n\noriginal transaction is an adjusting entry made before preparing financial statements. \n\nDeferrals are adjusting entries for items purchased in advance and used up in \n\nthe future (deferred expenses) or when cash is received in advance and earned in \n\nthe future (deferred revenue). \n\n**DEFERRED EXPENSES** \n\nDeferred expenses require adjusting entries. “Deferred” means “postponed into \n\nthe future.” In this case you have purchased something in “bulk” that will last you \n\nlonger than one month, such as supplies, insurance, rent, or equipment. Rather \n\nthan recording the item as an expense when you purchase it, you record it as an \n\nasset (something of value to the business) since you will not use it all up within a \n\nmonth. At the end of the month, you make an adjusting entry for the part that you \n\ndid use up—this is an expense, and you debit the appropriate expense account. The \n\ncredit part of the adjusting entry is the asset account, whose value is reduced by the \n\na",
    "mount used up. Any remaining balance in the asset account is what you still have \n\nleft to use up into the future. \n\n\n PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ACCOUNTING CYCLE SERVICE ACCRUAL \n\nThese are the five adjusting entries for deferred expenses we will cover. \n\n**Date Account Debit Credit** (^) ▲ _Supplies Expense_ is an **expense** account that is 6/30 Supplies Expense 100 **increasing**.

Accumulated Depreciation (^100) ▲ _Accumulated Depreciation_ is a **contra asset** account that is **increasing**. These will now each be explained in more detail. **SUPPLIES—DEFERRED EXPENSE** Supplies are relatively inexpensive operating items used to run your business. There are two ways to record the purchase of supplies. **Method #1: A company purchases $100 worth of supplies that will be used up within one month. Date Account Debit Credit** (^) ▲ _Supplies Expense_ is an **expense** 6/1 Supplies Expense 100 account that is **increasing**. Cash (^100) ▼ _Cash_ is an **asset** account that is **decreasing**.

    " some of these supplies, but you will wait until the end of the month to account for what you have used. Let’s assume you used $100 of the $1,000 of supplies you purchased on 6/1. If you DON’T “catch up” and adjust for the amount you used, you will show on your balance sheet that you have $1,000 worth of supplies at the end of the month when you actually have only $900 remaining. In addition, on your income statement you will show that you did not use ANY supplies to run the business during the month, when in fact you used $100 worth. The adjusting entry for supplies updates the **Supplies** and **Supplies Expense** balances to reflect what you really have at the end of the month. The adjusting entry TRANSFERS $100 from **Supplies** to **Supplies Expense**. It is journalized and posted BEFORE financial statements are prepared so that the income statement and balance sheet show the correct, up-to-date amounts. \n\n\n PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ACCOUNTING CYCLE SERVICE ACCRUAL \n\n**A",

The remaining $900 in the Supplies account will appear on the balance sheet. This amount is still an asset to the company since ",
    "it has not been used yet. \n\n**Summary** \n\n You had purchased supplies during the month and initially recorded them as an asset because they would last for more than one month. By the end of the month you used up some of these supplies, so you reduced the value of this asset to reflect what you actually had on hand at the end of the month ($900). What was used up ($100) became an expense, or cost of doing business, for the month. To transfer what was used, Supplies Expense was debited for the amount used and Supplies was credited to reduce the asset by the same amount. Any remaining balance in the Supplies account is what you have left to use in the future; it continues to be an asset since it is still available. The adjusting entry ensures that the amount of supplies used appears as a business expense on the income statement, not as an asset on the balance sheet. \n\n I MPORTANT: If this journal entry had been omitted, many errors on the financial statements would result. \n\n\n PRINCIPLES ",

As a college student, you have likely been involved in making a prepayment for a service you will receive in the future. When you paid your tuition for the semester, you paid “up front” for about three months of service (the courses you are taking!) As each month you attend class passes, you have one fewer month to go in terms of what you paid for. If you want to attend school after the semester is over, you have to prepay again for the next semester. \n\n The payme",
    "nt arrangement could be different. Your college could ask for four years’ tuition before you take your first class. Can you see this would be unrealistic? Alternatively, the college could ask for no payment up front at all and just charge a $10 cover charge as students arrive each day, stationing a bouncer at each classroom door. Equally unreasonable? Finally, the college could wait until the semester is over and collect all the tuition at the end. Craziest plan of all? \n\n The point is that a business has to select payment options that are reasonable and appropriate for their situations and circumstances and require payments in reasonable increments. What is suitable for one type of business may not work for another. \n\n\n PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ACCOUNTING CYCLE SERVICE ACCRUAL \n\n**FIXED ASSETS—DEFERRED EXPENSE** \n\n A fixed asset is a t angible/physical item owned by a business that is relatively expensive and has a permanent or long life—more than one year. Examples are equi",
    "pment, furnishings, vehicles, buildings, and land. Each of these is recorded as an asset at the time it is purchased. Its initial value, and the amount in the journal entry for the purchase, is what it costs. \n\n Example Journal Entry: A company purchased equipment that cost $6,000, paying cash. It is expected to last five years—its useful life. \n\n**Date Account Debit Credit** (^) ▲ _Equipment_ is an **asset** account that is 1/1 Equipment 6,000 **increasing**. Cash 6,000 ▼ _Cash_ is an **asset** account that is **decreasing**. Although fixed assets cost a company money, they are not initially recorded as expenses. (Notice in the journal entry above that the debit account is “Equipment,” NOT “Equipment Expense”). Fixed assets are first recorded as assets that later are gradually “expensed off,” or claimed as a business expense, over time. The process of “expensing off” the cost of a fixed asset as it is “used up” over its estimated useful life is **depreciation.** (NOTE: Land is propert",
    "y that does not “get used up;” therefore it is not depreciated.) **Example** In this case, assume that the equipment depreciates at a rate of $100 per month, which is determined by dividing its cost of $6,000 by 60 months (five years). After one month, the equipment is no longer worth $6,000. It has lost $100 of its initial value, so it is now worth only $5,900. An adjusting entry must be made to recognize this loss of value. Although supplies is not directly related to fixed assets, it may help to remember the adjusting entry for using up supplies in a month: **Date Account Debit Credit** (^) ▲ _Supplies Expense_ is an **expense** account that 1/31 Supplies Expense 100 is **increasing**. Supplies 100 ▼ _Supplies_ is an **asset** account that is **decreasing**. If we “expensed” off equipment in a similar way, the journal entry would look like this: ▲ _Equipment Expense_ is an **expense** account **Date Account Debit Credit** that is **increasing**. 1/31 Equipment Expense (^100) ▼ _Equi",
    "pment_ is an **asset** account that is Equipment 100 **decreasing**. \n\n\n PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ACCOUNTING CYCLE SERVICE ACCRUAL \n\n It makes sense since it follows the same pattern as supplies. In theory, it does do the job. However, the items in red are considered incorrect. There are two changes that will be made so that the journal entry is CORRECT for depreciation. \n\n1. Equipment Expense may be a valid account, but it is not used for     depreciation. It might instead be used for costs associated with owning     and running the equipment, such as maintenance, oil, parts, etc. To     recognize part of ANY fixed asset’s cost as a business expense, use     **Depreciation Expense** (not Equipment Expense)**.** \n\n2. In accounting, the **cost principle** requires that a fixed asset’s ledger     balance be the cost of the asset, or what was paid for it. In this example     it means that we are not allowed to credit the **Equipment** account to     reduce its balance from $6,00",
    "0 to the updated $5,900. Its balance must     stay at $6,000. \n\n Therefore, we will credit a different account instead since we require a credit account to complete the entry. This account is Accumulated Depreciation. Accumulated Depreciation is a contra asset account that appears on the balance sheet with a credit balance under the particular asset it relates to (which has a debit balance). This account is used as a substitute for the fixed asset account, which cannot be credited for the depreciation amount since the asset’s balance must always be its cost. \n\n The following is the CORRECT monthly adjusting entry for the depreciation of a fixed asset: \n\n**ADJUSTING ENTRY** (^) ▲ _Depreciation Expense_ is an **expense Date Account Debit Credit** account that is **increasing**. 1/31 Depreciation Expense (^100) ▲ _Acc. Depreciation_ is a **contra asset** Accumulated Depreciation 100 account that is **increasing.** Notice that **Depreciation Expense** substitutes for Equipment Expense, and",
    " **Accumulated Depreciation** substitutes for Equipment. Here are the **Equipment** _,_ **Accumulated Depreciation** _,_ and **Depreciation Expense** account ledgers AFTER the adjusting entry above has been posted. \n\n\n PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ACCOUNTING CYCLE SERVICE ACCRUAL \n\n Equipment Date Item Debit Credit Debit Credit 1/1 6,000 6,000 \n\n Accumulated Depreciation Depreciation Expense \n\n**Date Item Debit Credit Debit Credit Date Item Debit Credit Debit Credit** \n\n1/31 Adjusting 100 100 1/31 Adjusting 100 100 \n\n Since the Accumulated Depreciation account was credited in the adjusting entry rather than the Equipment account directly, the Equipment account balance remains at $6,000, its cost. The adjusting entry above is made at the end of each month for 60 months. Book Value is what a fixed asset is currently worth, calculated by subtracting an asset’s Accumulated Depreciation balance from its cost. This calculation is reported on the balance sheet. \n\n At the end of Cost Acc",
    "umulated Depreciation = Book Value 1 month $ 6,000 $ 100 $ 5,900 2 months 6,000 200 5,800 3 months 6,000 300 5,700 12 months 6,000 1,200 4,800 59 months 6,000 5,900 100 60 months 6,000 6,000 0 66 months 6,000 6,000 0 \n\n Accumulated Depreciation appears in the asset section of the balance sheet, so it is not closed out at the end of the month. Instead, its balance increases $100 each month. Here is its ledger after three months. \n\n Accumulated Depreciation Date Item Debit Credit Debit Credit 1/31 100 100 2/28 100 200 3/31 100 300 \n\nHere is the balance sheet presentation after three months: \n\n Equipment $ 6,000 Less: Accumulated depreciation 300 $ 5,700 \n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ACCOUNTING CYCLE SERVICE ACCRUAL \n\nThe adjusting entries split the cost of the equipment into two categories. The \n\n**Accumulated Depreciation** account balance is the amount of the asset that is \n\n“used up.” The **book value** is the amount of value remaining on the asset. As each \n\nmonth passes, the",
    " **Accumulated Depreciation** account balance increases and, \n\ntherefore, the book value decreases. \n\nAfter 60 months, the balance in the **Accumulated Depreciation** account is \n\n$6,000 and therefore the equipment is fully depreciated and has no value. However, \n\nthe business may continue to own and use the equipment. It just will not report \n\nany value for it on the balance sheet. After the asset is fully depreciated, no further \n\nadjusting entries are made for depreciation no matter how long the company owns \n\nthe asset. \n\nHere is calculation of the book value after 60 months: \n\n Equipment $ 6,000 Less: Accumulated depreciation 6,000 $ 0 \n\n**2.4 ADJUSTING ENTRIES—DEFERRALS** \n\nDeferrals are adjusting entries that update a previous transaction. The \n\nfirst journal entry is a general one; the journal entry that updates an account in \n\nthis original transaction is an adjusting entry made before preparing financial \n\nstatements. Deferrals are adjusting entries for items purchased in adv",
    "ance and \n\nused up in the future (deferred expenses) or when cash is received in advance and \n\nearned in the future (deferred revenue). \n\n**2.4.1 Deferred Revenue** \n\nDeferred revenues require adjusting entries. “Deferred” means “postponed \n\ninto the future.” In this case a customer has paid you in advance for a service you \n\nwill perform in the future. (Think of a gift card you issue to a customer.) When \n\nyou receive the cash, you debit the **Cash** account. However, you cannot credit your \n\nrevenue, or **Fees Earned** , account at that point because you have not yet earned \n\nthe money. Instead you credit **Unearned Fees** , which is a liability account, to \n\nrecognize that you owe the customer a certain dollar amount of service. \n\nAt the end of the month, you make an adjusting entry for the part of that pre\n\npayment that you did earn because you did do some of the work for the customer \n\nduring the month. At this time you debit **Unearned Fees** for the amount of \n\nservice provided,",
    " which reduces what you owe the customer. The credit part of the \n\nadjusting entry is the revenue account, whose value is increased by the amount \n\nearned. Any remaining balance in the liability account is what you still owe and \n\nhave left to earn in the future. \n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ACCOUNTING CYCLE SERVICE ACCRUAL \n\nThese are the two adjusting entries for deferred revenue we will cover. \n\n ▼ Unearned Fees is a liability Date Account Debit Credit account that is decreasing. \n\n6/30 Unearned Fees (^100) ▲ _Fees Earned_ is a **revenue** Fees Earned 100 account that is^ **increasing**. ▼ _Unearned Rent_ is a **liability** 6/30 Unearned Rent 100 account that is **decreasing**. Rent Revenue (^100) ▲ _Rent Revenue_ is a **revenue** account that is **increasing**. Both transactions above for deferred revenue are essentially the same, so the discussion will cover only the first one. The difference is that a landlord who deals in rent may prefer to name the accounts to better s",
    "uit the rental income business. **UNEARNED FEES—DEFERRED REVENUE** When a customer pre-pays a company for a service that the company will perform in the future, the company experiences deferred revenue. Fees are amounts that a company charges customers for performing services for them. A customer may pay the company immediately after the job is complete. **EXAMPLE** Here is a simple example to understand deferred revenue. Assume you are a hair stylist. Customer A comes in and you cut her hair. She pays you $30 cash. This is similar to the first example discussed. Customer B comes in and buys a gift card for $100 to give to her mother as a birthday present. At this point you have the cash but have not given any service in return. You owe the mother $100 worth of hair styling. Customer B’s mother comes in at a later date and you cut and style her hair for $40. You don’t collect any cash since she gives you the gift card. You reduce what you owe her by $40 for the work performed that day ",
    "you have now earned that $40. You still owe her service, but now you only owe $60 instead of $100. This is a form of deferred revenue. \n\n\n PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ACCOUNTING CYCLE SERVICE ACCRUAL \n\n Method #1: A company completes a job for a customer and receives $600 cash. \n\n The word “revenue” implies that the company has completed work for a customer.

The company will wait until the end of the month to account for \n\n\n PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ACCOUNTING CYCLE SERVICE ACCRUAL \n\n what",
    " it has earned. Let’s assume it earned $600 of the $1,000 that was prepaid. If the company DOES NOT “catch up” and adjust for the amount it earned, it will show on the balance sheet that it has $1,000 of service still due to the customer at the end of the month when it actually has only $400 still owed. In addition, on the income statement it will show that it did not earn ANY of the prepaid amount when in fact the company earned $600 of it. The adjusting entry for deferred revenue updates the Unearned Fees and Fees Earned balances so they are accurate at the end of the month. The adjusting entry is journalized and posted BEFORE financial statements are prepared so that the company’s income statement and balance sheet show the correct, up-todate amounts. \n\n**ADJUSTING ENTRY** (^) ▼ _Unearned Fees_ is a **liability Date Account Debit Credit** account that is **decreasing**. 6/30 Unearned Fees (^600) ▲ _Fees Earned_ is a **revenue** Fees Earned 600 account that is **increasing**. NOTE: T",
    "here are two ways this information can be worded, both resulting in the same adjusting entry above. \n\n1. The company earned $600 of the amount the customer prepaid. (So     $400 of service is owed.) \n\n2. The amount of unearned fees at the end of the month is $400. (So $600     worth was earned.) \n\n Here are the ledgers that relate to a prepayment for a service when the transaction above is posted. \n\n Unearned Fees Fees Earned \n\n**Date Item Debit Credit Debit Credit Date Item Debit Credit Debit Credit** \n\n6/1 1,000 1,000 6/30 600 600 \n\n6/30 600 400 \n\n The adjusting entry transfers $600 from the “unearned category” into the “earned category.” The $600 will become part of the balance in the Fees Earned account on the income statement at the end of the month. The remaining $400 in the Unearned Fees account will appear on the balance sheet. This amount is still a liability to the company since it has not been earned yet. \n\n**Summary** \n\n You accepted cash in advance of doing a job during th",
    "e month and initially recorded it as a liability. By the end of the month you earned some of this prepaid amount, so you reduced the value of this liability to reflect what you actually \n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ACCOUNTING CYCLE SERVICE ACCRUAL \n\nearned by the end of the month. What was earned became revenue. To do this, \n\n**Unearned Fees** was debited for the amount _earned_ and **Fees Earned** was \n\ncredited to increase revenue by the same amount. Any remaining balance in the \n\nUnearned Fees account is what you still owe in service in the future; it continues to \n\nbe a liability until it is earned. \n\nThe adjusting entry ensures that the correct amount of revenue _earned_ appears \n\non the income statement, not as a liability on the balance sheet. \n\n**IMPORTANT:** If this journal entry had been omitted, many errors on the financial \n\nstatements would result. \n\n1. The **Fees Earned** amount on the income statement would have been too low \n\nby $600. \n\n2. Net Income on the inc",
    "ome statement would have been too low (this revenue \n\nshould have been included but was not). \n\n3. The **Unearned Fees** amount on the balance sheet would have been too high \n\n($1,000 instead of $400). \n\n4. The total liabilities amount on the balance sheet would have been too high \n\nbecause **Unearned Fees** _,_ one liability, was too high. \n\n5. The **total stockholders’ equity** amount on the balance sheet would be too \n\n low because a net income that was too low amount would have been closed out to Retained Earnings. \n\n**2.4.2 Summary of Revenues** \n\nThere are three points in time: past, present, and future. There are also only \n\npossible debit accounts when **Fees Earned** is credited, reflecting these different \n\npoints in time. All three are possible ways business can be conducted. \n\n**PAST** – Cash was received before the services are provided. \n\n**Unearned Fees** is debited when work is completed. \n\n ▼ Unearned Fees is a liability Date Account Debit Credit account that is decrea",

Deferrals may be either deferred expenses or deferred revenue. Accruals may be either accrued expens",
    "es or accrued revenue. **2.5 ADJUSTING ENTRIES—ACCRUALS** Accrue means “to grow over time” or “accumulate.” Accruals are adjusting entries that record transactions in progress that otherwise would not be recorded because they are not yet complete. Because they are still in progress, but no journal entry has been made yet. Adjusting entries are made to ensure that the part that has occurred during a particular month appears on that same month’s financial statements. **2.5.1 Accrued Expenses** Accrued expenses require adjusting entries. In this case someone is already performing a service for you but you have not paid them or recorded any journal entry yet. The transaction is in progress, and the expense is building up (like a “tab”), but nothing has been written down yet. This may occur with employee wages, property taxes, and interest—what you owe is growing over time, but you typically don’t record a journal entry until you incur the full expense. However, if the end of an accounting ",
    "period arrives before you record any of these growing expenses, you will make an adjusting entry to include the part of the expense that belongs in that period and on that period’s financial statements. For the adjusting entry, you debit the appropriate expense account for the amount you owe through the end of the accounting period so this expense appears on your income statement. You credit an appropriate payable, or liability account, to indicate on your balance sheet that you owe this amount. \n\n\n PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ACCOUNTING CYCLE SERVICE ACCRUAL \n\nThese are the three adjusting entries for accrued expenses we will cover. \n\n**Date Account Debit Credit** (^) ▲ _Wages Expense_ is an **expense** 6/30 Wages Expense 100 account that is **increasing**.

    "1,000 4,000 NOTE: An expense is a cost of doing business, and it cost $4,000 in wages this month to run the business. **Adjusting journal entry:** Assume that June 30, the last day of the month, is a Tuesday. The Friday after, when the company will pay employees next, is July 3. Employees earn $1,000 per week, or $200 per day. Therefore, for this week, $400 of the $1,000 for the week should be a June expense and the other $600 should be a July expense. \n\n\n PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ACCOUNTING CYCLE SERVICE ACCRUAL \n\n An adjusting entry is required on June 30 so that the wages expense incurred on June 29 and June 30 appears on the June income statement. This entry splits the wages expense for that week: two days belong in June, and the other three days belong in July. Wages Expense is debited on 6/30, but Cash cannot be credited since 6/30 is a Tuesday and employees will not be paid until Friday. New liability account: Wages Payable. \n\n**ADJUSTING ENTRY** (^) ▲ _Wages Expense_ ",

The adjusting entry is journalized and posted BEFORE financial statements are prepared so that the company’s income statement and balance sheet show the correct, up-to-date amounts. **Summary** The company had already accumulated $4,000 in **Wages Expense** during June -$1,000 for each of four weeks. For the two additional work days in June, the 29th and 3",
    "0th, the company accrued $400 additional in **Wages Expense**. To add this additional amount so it appears on the June income statement, **Wages Expense** was debited. **Wages Payable** was credited and will appear on the balance sheet to show that this $400 is owed to employees for unpaid work in June. \n\n\n PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ACCOUNTING CYCLE SERVICE ACCRUAL \n\n IMPORTANT: If this journal entry had been omitted, many errors on the financial statements would result. \n\n1. The **Wages Expense** amount on the income statement would have been too     low ($4,000 instead of $4,400). \n\n2. **Net income** on the income statement would have been too high (An     additional $400 of **Wages Expense** should have been deducted from     revenues but was not). \n\n3. The **Wages Payable** amount on the balance sheet would have been too low ($0     instead of $400). \n\n4.

Typically the business operates for a year and pays its annual property taxes at the end of that year. At the beginning of the year, the company does have an estimate of what its total property tax bill will be at the end of the year. \n\n Assume that a company’s annual (January 1 to December 31) property taxes are estimated to be $6,000. \n\n If the company prepares 12 monthly financial statements during the year, 1/12 of this estimate, or $500, should be included on each month’s s",
    "tatements since this expense is accruing over time. New liability account: Taxes Payable. No journal entry is made at the beginning of each month. At the end of each month, $500 of taxes expense has accumulated/accrued for the month. At the end of January, no property tax will be paid since payment for the entire year is due at the end of the year. However, $500 is now owed. \n\n**ADJUSTING ENTRY** (^) ▲ _Taxes Expense_ is an **expense Date Account Debit Credit** account that is **increasing**. 1/31 Taxes Expense (^500) ▲ _Taxes Payable_ is a **liability** Taxes Payable 500 account that is **increasing**.

At the end of each accounting period, you record the part of the job that you did complete as a sale. This involves a debit to Accounts Receivable to acknowledge that the customer owes you for what you have completed and a credit to Fees Earned to record the revenue earned thus far. \n\n**FEES EARNED—ACCRUED REVENUE** \n\n Revenue is earned as a job is performed. Sometimes an entire job is not completed within the accounting period, and the company will not bill the customer until the job is completed. The earnings from the part of the job that has been completed must be reported on the mo",
    "nth’s income statement for this accrued revenue, and an adjusting entry is required. \n\n Assume that a company begins a job for a customer on June 1. It will take two full months to complete the job. When it is complete, the company will then bill the customer for the full price of $4,000. \n\n No journal entry is made at the beginning of June when the job is started. At the end of each month, the amount that has been earned during the month must be reported on the income statement. If the company earned $2,500 of the $4,000 in June, it must journalize this amount in an adjusting entry. \n\n**ADJUSTING ENTRY** (^) ▲ _Accounts Receivable_ is an **asset Date Account Debit Credit** account that is **increasing**. 6/30 Accounts Receivable 2,500 (^) ▲ _Fees Earned_ is a **revenue** Fees Earned 2,500 account that is **increasing**.

    "ses where companies sell expertise, knowledge, experiences, or the use of something to customers. In a service business, customers do not purchase or take ownership of a physical product. Merchandising businesses sell products. A merchandising business buys finished and packaged manufactured products, marks them up, and sells them to customers. A merchandiser , therefore, may be either the buyer or the seller in a given transaction, depending upon whether product is being purchased (and added to the stock of inventory), or sold (and removed from the stock of inventory.) A vendor is a company or individual that a merchandiser purchases goods from. A customer is a company or individual that a merchandiser sells goods to. Inventory consists of items that are purchased for resale. Note that inventory is different from supplies. Supplies are items that are purchased to be used in the operation of the business, not to be sold to customers. For example, a merchandiser may have Windex glass cl",
    "eaner on hand. It is considered inventory if it will be resold to customers and is considered a supply if it is used in running the business to keep the check-out counters clean. Similarly, inventory is also different from fixed assets such as equipment. For example, a merchandiser may have desktop computers on hand. They are considered inventory if they are to be resold to customers, such as in the case of Best Buy , Dell , or Apple. They would be classified as equipment if the merchandiser is using the computers to run its own business operations. Sales is the new revenue account used to record income from selling products. This account replaces Fees Earned , the revenue account used for a service business. The following are common sequences of events for merchandising businesses. When you are the buyer , you will (1) purchase product on account; (2) return product; and (3) pay for the product. When you are the seller , you will (1) sell product on account and reduce the inventory ba",
    "lance; (2) accept returns and increase the inventory balance; and (3) receive payment for sales. Most merchandising businesses use a perpetual inventory system.

It is an expanded, more detailed version of the single-step income statement. The most significant cost that a merchandise business incurs is the cost of acquiring the inventory that is sold. It is important to match what was paid for an item to what it sells for. The multi-step income statement presents financial information so this relationship may easily be seen. Here is a basic income statement for a me",
    "rchandising business. Notice that Cost of Merchandise Sold , an expense account, is matched up with net sales at the top of the statement. \n\n MERCHANDISING BUSINESS 1 Income Statement For the Month Ended June 30, 2013 \n\nSales $1,000 Prices charged to customers on all inventory sold \n\nLess: Sales returns $40 Reduction in sales for items customers brought back \n\n Sales Discounts 20 60 Amount of discounts taken by customers for early payment \n\n**Net Sales** 940 Actual sales after return and discounts are removed \n\nCost of merchandise sold 340 What the company paid for the inventory that was sold \n\n**Gross profit** 600 Mark-up, or the difference between selling price and cost \n\nOperating expenses: List of costs to the business unrelated to the cost of inventory \n\n Wages expense $150 Supplies expense 30 Depreciation expense 20 200 Total of costs unrelated to the cost of inventory \n\n**Net income** $400 Profit for the month \n\n There are three calculated amounts on the multi-step income statem",
    "ent for a merchandiser net sales, gross profit, and net income. \n\n- Net Sales = Sales - Sales Returns - Sales Discounts \n\n- Gross Profit = Net Sales - Cost of Merchandise Sold \n\n- Net Income = Gross Profit - Operating Expenses \n\n Net sales is the actual sales generated by a business. It represents everything that “went out the door” in sales minus all that came back in returns and in the form of sales discounts. \n\n\n PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ACCOUNTING CYCLE MERCHANDISING BUSINESS \n\n Gross profit is the same as “markup.” It is the difference between what a company paid for a product and what it sells the product for to its customer. Net income is the business’s profit after all expenses have been deducted from the net sales amount. A more complex manufacturing business may break out its operating expenses into two categories on the income statement: selling expenses and administrative expenses. Selling expenses are related to the people and efforts used to market and promote t",
    "he product to customers. Administrative expenses relate to the general management of the business and may include costs such as the company president’s office and the human resources and accounting departments. An example is shown below. \n\n MERCHANDISING BUSINESS 2 Income Statement For the Month Ended June 30, 2013 \n\nSales $1,000 Prices charged to customers on all inventory sold \n\nLess: Sales returns $40 Reduction in sales for items customers brought back \n\n Sales Discounts 20 60 Amount of discounts taken by customers for early payment \n\n**Net Sales** 940 Actual sales after return and discounts are removed \n\nCost of merchandise sold 340 What the company paid for the inventory that was sold \n\n**Gross profit** 600 Mark-up, or the difference between selling price and cost \n\nSelling expenses: Costs related to marketing and selling products \n\n Sales salaries expense 50 Sales supplies expense 30 Depreciation expense 10 \n\nAdministrative expenses: Costs related to the general management of the",

First, at the beginning of the accounting period (such as a year), a merchandising company estimates how much of its sales are likely to be returned during the year. On the first day of the year, the entire anticipated amount of sales returns is recorded in a journal entry. Under the perpetual system, a second entry simultaneously is recorded to estimate the c",
    "ost of the merchandise returned. These entries attempt to match the sales for the year to the amount of sales returns in the same year. They do not represent an actual return, but instead an estimate of actual returns to come. 4a.

If the buyer pays within a designated time period, he/she will pay less than the full purchase price to satisfy the full invoice amount. Only consider the discount when cash is actually paid by the purchaser. Before ",
    "that, at the time of the purchase, neither party may be certain whether payment will be made within the discount period or not. \n\n\n PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ACCOUNTING CYCLE MERCHANDISING BUSINESS \n\n The amount of discount allowed is stated on the invoice using the following terminology: \n\n- **Net 30** means the entire amount of the invoice is due in 30 days and     no discount is allowed for early payment \n\n- **2/10, net 30** means the purchaser may take a 2% discount on the     cost of the merchandise if he pays within 10 days; otherwise, the entire     amount of the invoice is due in 30 days. Other numbers may appear for     the “2” and “10” to indicate a different percentage and/or a different     number of days to qualify for the discount (such as **1/15** - 1% discount if     paid within 15 days). \n\n Transactions 8 and 9 are for purchases of product that will be resold. Merchandise Inventory is the account used to record the discount for the purchaser under the perpetua",
    "l inventory system. It is credited to reduce the original debit by the amount of the discount, so ultimately the inventory is valued at the amount of cash paid for it. \n\n8.

    " The inventory account is reduced by $10 to recognize that the actual value of the inventory in the ledger is $490 – the amount of cash paid for it. **3.3.2 Merchandising Transactions (perpetual inventory system) with Discounts – The Seller** There are two methods for recording sales transactions when the seller offers its customer a discount to pay early. The choice depends on when the seller expects the buyer to pay. If the seller expects the buyer to pay the full amount after the discount period has expired, the gross method is typically used and the sale is recorded at the full amount. If the seller expects the buyer to pay the reduced amount within the discount period, the net method is usually selected and the sale \n\n\n PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ACCOUNTING CYCLE MERCHANDISING BUSINESS \n\n is recorded at the selling price minus the discount amount. The goal is to best match revenue to the period in which it is earned. In the examples that follow, the sale under the gross me",
    "thod is recorded at the full amount of $750. The sale under the net method is recorded at that amount minus the discount, or $735. The amount for the entry to reduce the inventory and increase cost of goods sold is the same for both methods. \n\n**GROSS METHOD NET METHOD** \n\n10a.

It is important to know which company either the seller or the purchaser owns the merchandise while it is in transit and in the hands of a third-party transportation",
    " company, such as UPS. The company that owns the merchandise must absorb the transportation cost as a business expense. The shipping terms specify which company owns the merchandise while in transit. Terms may be **FOB destination** or **FOB shipping.** The acronym FOB stands for “Free On Board” and is a shipping term used in retail to indicate who is responsible for paying transportation charges. It is also the location where ownership of the merchandise transfers from seller to buyer. If the shipping terms are **FOB destination** , ownership transfers at the destination, so the seller owns the merchandise all the while it in transit. Therefore, the seller absorbs the transportation cost and debits **Delivery Expense.** The buyer records nothing. If the terms are **FOB shipping** , ownership transfers at the origin as it leaves the seller’s facility, so the buyer owns the merchandise all the while it is in transit. The buyer therefore absorbs the transportation cost and debits **Merch",

In the case of FOB shipping, the buyer may contract directly with the transportation company (and the seller records nothing) OR the seller may pre-pay the shipping costs and pass them along in the invoice to the buyer. \n\nThere are three possible scenarios regarding transportation, as follows: \n\n1.

    "the _Cost of Merchandise Sold_ and _Merchandising Inventory_ accounts are not maintained on an ongoing basis during the accounting period. Therefore, at the end of the year, an entry must be made to record the total amount of cost of merchandise sold for the year and to adjust the _Merchandising Inventory_ account to its current ending balance. This is done by deducting the ending inventory balance, which includes items that were not yet sold, from the total cost of goods available for sale during the year. As an example, assume the following about a company’s inventory for the year. Beginning inventory on January 1 $ 10,000 Purchases 30,000 Freight-in 5,000 Purchases Discounts (1,000) Purchases Returns (2,000) Ending inventory balance on December 31 8,000 Total cost of goods available for sale during the year is $42,000, determined by adding the first five amounts above.

Occasionally businesses will take a physical inventory count to determine if it actually has all items it thinks it has per its accounting records. **Inventory shrinkage** is the difference that results when the amount of actual inventory physically counted is less than the am",

A merchandiser may therefore be either the buyer or the seller in a given transaction. Inventory is items that are purchased for resale. The process of inventory valuation involves determining the quantities and dollar value of the inventory that a company owns. The perpetual inventory system is the process of keeping a current running total of inventory, both in number of units on hand and its dollar value, at all times. When product is purchased for resale, inventory immediately increases. When inventory is sold, its total value",
    " is immediately reduced. Items in inventory are not always purchased at the same price; the same items may cost different amounts at different times. Therefore, a business needs a system of deciding which cost to select as its expense amount for Cost of Merchandise Sold when it sells an item. As a simple example, let’s say a company has purchased 30 identical items for resale to customers. It bought 10 items on 2/2 for $1 each, 10 items on 2/3 for $2 each, and 10 items on 2/4 for $3 each. The total cost of the 30 units in inventory is $60. \n\n Date Purchases 2/2 10 $1 $10 2/3 10 $2 $20 2/4 10 $3 $30 TOTAL 30 $60 \n\n The issue is this: If the company sells ONE item to a customer for $10, the cost of that one item needs to be determined. \n\n**Date Account Debit Credit** (^) ▲ _Accounts Receivable_ is an **asset** account that is 2/12 Accounts Receivable 10 **increasing**.

(^) ▼ _Merchandise Inventory_ is an **asset** account that is **decreasing**. The company will select an accepted method of valuing withdrawals from inventory. Three common methods are the following: **FIFO** (First-In, First-Out) method withdraws inventory beginning with those units purchased earliest. In the example above, the **Cost of Merchandise Sold** would be $1, one of the items purchased on 2/2. As a result, the gross profit on the sale would be $9 ($10 $1). **LIFO** (Last-In, First-Out) method withdraws inventory beginning with those units purchased most recently. In the example above, the **Cost of Merchandise Sold** would be $3, one of the items purchased on 2/4. As a result, the gross profit on the sale would be $7 ($10 $3). **Average Cost Method** uses an average of the cost of all items ",
    "currently in stock. In the example above, the average is $60/30 units, so the **Cost of Merchandise Sold** would be $2 per unit. As a result, the gross profit on the sale would be $8 ($10 $2). We will be answering the following four questions about inventory for an accounting period: \n\n1. What is total sales? \n\n2. What is total cost of merchandise sold? \n\n3. What is gross profit? \n\n4. What is the ending inventory balance? \n\n**4.1.1 Perpetual Inventory System** \n\n**INVENTORY GRIDS** \n\n By entering transactions into a cost grid, you can organize your data to easily determine Cost of Merchandise Sold amounts and Merchandise Inventory balances after every purchase and sale. The grids show increases in Merchandise Inventory due to purchases, decreases in Merchandise Inventory due to sales, and the running Merchandise Inventory balance. The following grid organizes the purchases and sales of a merchandiser for one of its products. It is essentially an expanded Merchandise Inventory account l",
    "edger. Not only does it show the dollar amount for each transaction and the updated running balance in dollars, but it also keeps track of the number of items bought, sold, and currently in inventory. \n\n\n PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ASSETS IN MORE DETAIL \n\n**SAMPLE INVENTORY COST GRID** \n\n**Date Purchases Cost of Merchandise Sold Inventory Balance** \n\n Units Cost Total Units Cost Total Units Cost Total \n\n 6/1 10 $4 $40 \n\n 6/5 1 $4 $4 9 $4 $36 \n\n6/10 10 $5 $50 9 $4 $36 \n\n 10 $5 $50 \n\n The Purchases columns show the details about items that were bought on different dates for resale to customers. Entries in the Purchases columns are the same regardless of the inventory valuation method selected. For a purchase, there is a debit to Merchandise Inventory and total inventory increases. The Cost of Merchandise Sold columns show the detail about the order in which items are withdrawn from inventory for each sale. The amounts in these columns will vary based on whether the method is FIFO",
    ", LIFO, or average cost. For a sale, there is a debit to Cost of Merchandise Sold and total inventory decreases. The Inventory Balance columns keep a running total of the number of items and their costs on each date. Each purchase is added to any inventory balance that already appears there. With a purchase, it is a good practice to first copy down what was in stock on the previous date in the Inventory Balance columns and add the new purchase below that. This clearly shows what is in stock on any given date. Each sale reduces the inventory balance by the cost of merchandise sold amount. \n\n NOTE: Only costs are entered into the grid; not the price that you sell the merchandise for to customers. If you are given the selling price, you can also determine the amount of sales and gross profit amounts outside of the grid. \n\n There is a journal entry that corresponds to each purchase and sale. One key reason for the grid is that it enables you to determine the amounts for the cost of merchan",
    "dise sold for each sale. \n\n\n PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ASSETS IN MORE DETAIL \n\n FIFO under the perpetual inventory system—FIFO (first-In, first-out) is a method of inventory valuation where the cost of the items purchased earliest is used in Cost of Merchandise Sold when one item is resold. The balance in Merchandise Inventory, which includes those items still available for sale, is comprised of the costs of those items purchased most recently. \n\n**Four inventory questions under FIFO:** \n\n1. **What is total sales?** 19 units, $190     (1 + 12 + 6) = 19 units sold x $10 per unit \n\n2. **What is total cost of merchandise sold?** $85     ($4 + $36 + $15 + $30) from cost of merchandise sold     column \n\n3. **What is gross profit?** $105     Sales – cost of merchandise sold is $190 - $85 \n\n4. **What is the ending inventory balance?** 11 units, $65     6/30 inventory balance amounts in cost grid \n\n6/1 The inventory balance that is given is entered.

This is deducted from the inventory balance. \n\n6/10 Purchases are entered in the Purchases columns and added to the inventory balance. \n\n6/16 Now it is important to know you are using FIFO. The customer ordered 12 items. You have 19 in stock at two different costs. Under FIFO you use the “oldest” ones first – the $4 items. You sell all 9 of those and then need 3 items that cost $5 to complete the order. You use two lines in the Cost of Merchandise Sold columns – one for each unit cost. This is deducted from the inventory balance. \n\n6/22 Purchases are entered in the Purchases columns and added to the inventory balance. \n\n6/30 The customer ordered 6 items.

You have 17 in stock at an average cost of $5.39 per unit. The amount of 6 x $5.39 is deducted from the inventory balance. \n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ASSETS IN MORE DETAIL \n\nThe results of the preceding example for both FIFO and LIFO under the \n\nperpetual inventory system can be summarized in four questions. \n\n",
    "**Four inventory questions FIFO LIFO Average cost** \n\n1. What is total sales? (19 units) $190.00 $190.00 $190.00 \n\n2. What is total cost of merchandise sold? (19 units) 85.00 98.00 90.70 \n\n3. What is gross profit? 105.00 92.00 99.30 \n\n4. What is the ending inventory balance? (11 units) 65.00 52.00 58.74 \n\nUnder all three methods, 19 units were sold and total sales were $190. Notice, \n\nhowever, that under FIFO the 19 units COST $85, under LIFO these same 19 units \n\nCOST $98, and under average cost these same 19 units COST $90.70. This is a $13 \n\ndifference between the highest and lowest costing method. \n\nGross profit is also different among the three methods. Because less cost is \n\ndeducted from sales under the FIFO method, gross profit is $13 higher under FIFO \n\nthan it is for LIFO. \n\nThat $13 difference also appears in the ending inventory balances. Since the cost \n\nof merchandise sold was lower under FIFO than it was under LIFO and average cost, \n\nthe ending inventory balance under F",
    "IFO is higher that with the other two methods. \n\nTo summarize, there is a $13 difference between FIFO and LIFO in the cost \n\nof goods sold and ending inventory amounts. FIFO includes that $13 as part of \n\nending inventory; LIFO considers that $13 to be part of cost of merchandise sold. \n\nNOTE: The pattern above will result when costs are rising over time. In this \n\nexample, they increased from $4 to $5 to $6. If costs decrease over time, the results \n\nwill be the opposite: LIFO would include the difference as part of ending inventory \n\nand FIFO would consider the difference to be part of cost of merchandise sold. \n\nThe results for the average cost method typically fall between those for LIFO \n\nand FIFO. \n\n**4.1.2 Periodic Inventory System** \n\nAs was mentioned in the merchandising discussion, some companies do not \n\nkeep an ongoing running inventory balance as was shown under the perpetual \n\ninventory system. Instead, these companies choose to wait until the end of the \n\naccounting peri",
    "od, just before financial statements are prepared, to conduct a \n\nphysical inventory count to determine (1) how much ending inventory they still \n\nhave in stock (counted) and (2) how much inventory they have sold during the \n\nperiod, which is their cost of merchandise sold (calculated). \n\nCost of merchandise sold is determined by first calculating cost of merchandise \n\navailable for sale, which is the beginning inventory value plus purchases during \n\nthe period. \n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ASSETS IN MORE DETAIL \n\nThe same three flow methods of withdrawing inventory from stock—FIFO, \n\nLIFO, and average cost—are used under the periodic system. The periodic \n\nsystem disregards the dates of the purchases and sales and just looks at the \n\ntotals of each collectively. \n\n**FIFO UNDER THE PERIODIC INVENTORY SYSTEM** \n\nUnder FIFO, the **19 units sold** are drawn from earliest inventory in stock to \n\ndetermine cost of goods sold.

Because less cost is \n\ndeducted from sales under the FIFO method, gross profit is $30 higher under \n\nFIFO that it is for LIFO. \n\nThat $30 difference also appears in the ending inventory balances. Since the \n\ncost of merchandise sold was lower under FIFO than it was under LIFO and average \n\ncost, the ending inventory balance under FIFO is higher that with the other two \n\nmethods. \n\nTo summarize, there is a $30 difference between FIFO and LIFO in the cost \n\nof goods sold and ending inventory amounts.

    "hod, it may take an additional step to ensure that \n\nthe value of the inventory that is reported is not misinterpreted or overstated. \n\nLower-of-cost-or-market is an additional calculation that is used to value inventory \n\nif the cost of a product (or products) declines after the item(s) has been purchased \n\nfor inventory. “Market” can be interpreted as replacement cost, or what the item \n\nis selling for today. The company lists all the products it sells and for each product \n\ncompares the price paid (cost) to the current market value.

These may include: \n\n a. Items on consignment from someone else (the company has agreed to sell someone else’s product for them) \n\n**KEEPING UP WITH THE TIMES** \n\nA business has two models of cell phones in stock to sell to customers. \n\n It has 200 units of Model #1. Each of those cost the company $100. If the company were to buy these phones today, each unit would cost $110. \n\n It also has 200 units of Model #2, which were purchased two years ago for $100 per unit. The market price for these is currently $60 per unit. It has dropped because these units are somewhat out of date. \n\n If lower-of-cost-or-mar",
    "ket is NOT used, the total inventory is valued at $40,000. \n\n Model #1: 200 x $100 = $20,000 (number of units x cost per unit) Model #2: 200 x $100 = 20,000 (number of units x cost per unit) Total $40,000 \n\nIf lower-of-cost-or-market is used, the total inventory is valued at $32,000. \n\n Model #1: 200 x $100 = $20,000 (number of units x cost per unit) Model #2: 200 x $ 60 = 12,000 (number of units x market price Total $32,000 per unit since it is lower) \n\n The inventory should be reported at $32,000 on the balance sheet even though it was purchased for $40,000. This gives the reader a clearer picture of what the inventory is actually worth. \n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ASSETS IN MORE DETAIL \n\nb. Items in for warranty repair (the company does not re-possess these) \n\n c. Items held aside for customers that have been paid for already (ownership has been transferred) \n\n The following items would be owned by the company and should be included: a.

A sample ledger for a new business that began on June 1 is shown below. \n\n Almost all companies open a checking account at a bank to safeguard their cash as well as to be able to accept and write checks, transfer funds electronically, and make and receive loan payments. The bank provides an independent record of the account holder’s cash transactions up to the current date on bank statements, which are available \n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ASSETS IN MORE DETAIL \n\nonline. Each monthly bank",
    " statement typically lists a beginning balance, deposits, \n\nwithdrawals, and an ending balance related to that time period. \n\nThe following sample online bank statement lists transactions that a business \n\nmay typically expect to see each month: \n\n**4.2.1 Bank Reconciliation** \n\nSince cash is susceptible to theft, fraud, and loss, it is important to continuously \n\nverify that the amount shown in the ledger balance is what the business actually \n\nhas. A bank reconciliation helps do this. A bank reconciliation compares the \n\ncompany’s record of cash on hand to the bank statement, adjusts for missing or \n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ASSETS IN MORE DETAIL \n\nincorrect entries, and is complete when the result equals the ending balance on \n\nthe bank statement. A bank reconciliation should be completed at least once a \n\nmonth but can be done more frequently using online statements that provide up\n\nto-date information. \n\nOne key purpose of the bank reconciliation is to notify the accoun",
    "t holder of \n\ntransactions that the bank has processed on the company’s behalf so the company \n\ncan record them and update its cash balance accordingly. \n\nBegin the reconciliation process by comparing the company’s cash ledger to \n\nthe bank statement. \n\nFirst, check off all transactions that match in both the ledger and on the bank \n\nstatement to indicate that both the company and the bank have recorded these \n\nitems. This is shown as red checkmarks on the right side in both the sample cash \n\nledger and the sample bank statement on the previous page. \n\nThe bank reconciliation is a two-fold process. Essentially what it accomplishes is \n\nto update the company’s balance and update the bank balance for items each party \n\ndid not yet know about and therefore had not recorded at the end of the month. \n\nSecondly, update the company’s _Cash_ ledger balance to include amounts from \n\nthe bank statement that are not yet listed in the ledger AND adjust for any errors \n\nin the ledger.

A note receivable is a loan contract that specifies the principal (amount of the loan), the interest rate stated as an annual percentage, and the terms stated in number of days or months. **4.3.1 Issue Date** There are two situations where a company may receive a short-term note. \n\n1. A direct short-term loan for cash when an employee or other individual     asks to borrow money and the company agrees and distributes cash. \n\n In the following example, a company received a 60-day, 12% note for $1,000 from one of its executives on January 1. \n\n**Date Account Debit Credit** \n\n1/1 Note",

At that time the **Note Receivable** account must be credited for the principle amount. In addition, the amount of interest earned must be recorded in the journal entry as **Interest Revenue**. The amount of interest is calculated using the following equation: Principal x Rate x Time = Interest Earned **To simplify the math, we will assume every month has 30 days and each year has 360 days.** For a 12% interest rate on a 60-day note, the interest on a $1,000 note would be $20, calculated as follows: $1,000 x 12% x 60/360 = $20 **Note that since the 12% is an annual rate (for 12 months), it must be prorated for the number of months or days (60/360 days or 2/12 months) in the term of the loan.** \n\n\n PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ASSETS IN MORE DETAIL \n\n On the maturity date, both the No",

However, there may be cases when customers default on their accounts and can or will never pay. If the company is certain that it will never be paid, it can write off the customer’s account and claim the non-payment as a business expense. A write-off is forgiveness of a customer’s debt. This is done only when a company is absolutely certain that a customer can never pay (due to death, bankruptcy, his own admission, etc.) There are two methods for recording bad debt. \n\n1. Direct write-off method—for companies that rarely have bad debt \n\n2. Allowance method—for companies that consistently have bad debt \n\n The method a company selects depends on how frequently it anticipates it will experience bad debt. A business such as a movie theater, which primarily accepts cash from customers rather than invoici",

Conversely, a utility company that provides electricity to homeowners constantly must write off bad debt as customers cannot pay or move and do not pay their last bill. The movie theater would select the direct method; the utility company would employ the allowance method. \n\n**4.4.1 Direct Write-off Method** \n\n The direct write-off method is used by companies that rarely experience any bad debt.

Fixed \n\nassets are also called **Property, Plant and Equipment**. \n\nEquipment and other fixed assets are definitely costs of running a \n\nbusiness. However, the company does not debit an expense account such as \n\n_Equipment Expense_ for its cost at the time of purchase. If this were done, the \n\nincome statement for the year of the purchase would have this large expense that \n\nreduces net income. The other years’ income statements would show no expense \n\nf",
    "or this equipment, even though the equipment is used during this time. Instead of \n\nan expense account, the company records the purchase of a fixed asset by debiting \n\nan asset account for its cost. For equipment, the **Equipment** account is debited. \n\n\n PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ASSETS IN MORE DETAIL \n\nThe following journal entry records the purchase of equipment for $27,900 cash. \n\n**Date Account Debit Credit** (^) ▲ _Equipment_ is an **asset** account that is 1/1 Equipment 27,900 **increasing**. Cash 27,900 ▼ _Cash_ is an **asset** account that is **decreasing**. **Depreciation** is the periodic expiration of a fixed asset, which means its cost is gradually claimed as an expense over its useful life rather than all at once at the time it is purchased. The company recognizes that a portion of the asset is “used up” as time passes or as the asset is used. The value that a fixed asset loses each year becomes an expense. All fixed assets except Land are depreciated. Land is co",
    "nsidered to be permanent property that is not “used up;” therefore it is not depreciated. **4.5.1 Depreciation Terms Cost** is the amount a company pays or the value it exchanges to acquire a fixed asset. The cost includes the price of the asset plus everything it takes to get the asset to the company and up and running, such as transportation, sales tax, insurance in transit, professional fees of attorneys or engineers, site preparation, and installation. The cost of the asset does not include damage or vandalism during shipment or installation. **EXAMPLE** Equipment + transportation + sales tax + installation cost = depreciable cost of the asset $9,000 + $350 + $450 + $200 = $10,000 depreciable cost of the equipment Some fixed assets have a **residual value**. This is a minimal guaranteed amount that someone will pay at any time, even if the asset no longer is functional, to purchase it from the owner. For example, the manufacturer of a piece of equipment may pay a company a minimal ",
    "amount and haul away an old piece of equipment that it may then disassemble for spare parts or scrap metal. \n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ASSETS IN MORE DETAIL \n\n**EXAMPLE** \n\n Years ago, my dad worked in an area where nice cars tended to disappear from their parking spaces. He chose to drive old “clunkers” that did not appeal to car thieves. Each “clunker” would ultimately die in front of our nice suburban home, and my mother would soon be after him to remove it from the premises. Dad would call his “junk dealer,” a man with a tow truck who would pay my father $50 and haul the wreck off. No matter how bad the condition one of those vehicles was in, it was always worth at least the $50 the “junk dealer” was willing to pay for it. Its residual value was $50. \n\nThe **useful life** is the length of time or amount of activity that a fixed asset is \n\nexpected to last or have value to a company. It is often measured in years of service, \n\nbut may also be stated in terms of usage, suc",
    "h as miles, hours, or units of output. \n\n**EXAMPLE** \n\n Two people may buy the identical cars for the same price on the same day. If depreciation is measured in years, both cars may be expected to last for eight years. However, if one driver is a salesman who is always on the road traveling long distances and the other is a retiree who drives locally and only occasionally, it is likely that the salesman’s car will last fewer years than the retiree’s. It may be more meaningful to state the useful life in miles, such as 150,000 miles, to better track the usage of the vehicles. In fact, automobile warranties are often stated in dual ways, such as “five years or 60,000 miles, whichever comes first.” Similarly, rather than years, the useful life of a light bulb might be number of hours and a photocopy machine might be number of copies. \n\n**Depreciation Expense** is an expense account on the income statement that \n\nis closed at the end of each accounting period. Debit **Depreciation Expense*",
    "* \n\nrather than _Equipment Expense_ , _Building Expense_ , _Truck Expense_ , etc. for the \n\namount of a fixed asset that has been “used up” during the accounting period. \n\nAlthough the value of a fixed asset decreases over time or with usage, the **cost** \n\n**principle** requires that a fixed asset’s ledger balance be the cost of the asset, \n\nor what was paid for it. We cannot credit the asset’s debit balance to show that \n\nit is losing value—its debit balance in the ledger must always be what it cost. In \n\nthe previous equipment example it means that we are not allowed to credit the \n\n**Equipment** account to reduce its balance from $27,900. Its balance must stay at \n\n$27,900 as long as the company owns it. \n\n**Accumulated Depreciation** substitutes for the fixed asset account and \n\nis credited to complete the entry. **Accumulated Depreciation is a contra** \n\n**asset** account that appears in the Asset section on the balance sheet just under \n\nthe particular asset it relates to. It is",
    " not closed at the end of the accounting \n\n\n PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ASSETS IN MORE DETAIL \n\n period. Instead, its credit balance increases each year as a fixed asset loses more and more value. Each fixed asset account has its own Accumulated Depreciation account. The fixed asset account has a debit balance for the cost of the asset. The Accumulated Depreciation has a credit balance that indicates how much value the fixed asset has lost. \n\nThe adjusting entry for depreciation is as follows: \n\n**Date Account Debit Credit** (^) ▲ _Depreciation Expense_ is an **expense** 1/31 Depreciation Expense 8,700 account that is **increasing**. Accumulated Depreciation 8,700 (^) ▲ _Acc. Depreciation_ is a **contra asset** account that is **increasing.** Since the **Accumulated Depreciation** account was credited in the adjusting entry rather than the **Equipment** account directly, the **Equipment** debit account balance in the previous transaction remains at $27,900, its cost. Here is a ",
    "sample of how a fixed asset is presented on the balance sheet: Equipment $27,900 Less: Accumulated depreciation 8,700 $19,200 The **book value** of a fixed asset is what it is currently worth. The cost of a fixed asset is what was originally paid to acquire it. The credit balance in Accumulated Depreciation indicates how much of the asset’s cost has been “used up.” Book value is calculated by subtracting an asset’s **Accumulated Depreciation** credit balance from its cost. This calculation is reported on the balance sheet. **Book value = Cost Accumulated Depreciation** The following is the book value of equipment that cost $27,900 at the end of each year in its useful life, assuming it depreciates at a rate of $8,700 per year. This is shown on the balance sheet as follows: **2012 2013 2014** Equipment $27,900 $27,900 $27,900 Less: Accumulated depreciation 8,700 17,400 26,100 Book Value $19,200 $10,500 $1,800 Accumulated Depreciation increases over time. Book value decreases over time b",
    "y the same amount. \n\n\n PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ASSETS IN MORE DETAIL \n\n The adjusting entries for depreciation split the cost of the equipment into two categories. The Accumulated Depreciation account balance is the amount of the asset that is “used up”. The book value is the amount of value remaining on the asset. It is important monitor the book value of fixed assets since the book value cannot be lower than the residual value. A company must stop depreciating any further once the book value equals the residual value since the asset will always be worth at least what someone will pay to purchase it from the owner, regardless of its condition. However, even there is no longer any remaining value to depreciate, a company may still continue to use a fixed asset. \n\n**4.5.2 Depreciation Methods** \n\n We will look at three methods of calculating the amount of depreciation on a fixed asset that should be recorded in the adjusting entry at the end of the accounting period. A compan",
    "y will select one method for each of its assets and use that method throughout the useful life of the asset. Each method requires that you know the cost of the asset, any residual value, and its useful life. Regardless of the method used, the adjusting entry is a debit to Depreciation Expense and a credit to Accumulated Depreciation. \n\nThe adjusting entry for depreciation is as follows: \n\n**Date Account Debit Credit** (^) ▲ _Depreciation Expense_ is an **expense** 1/31 Depreciation Expense XXX account that is **increasing**. Accumulated Depreciation XXX (^) ▲ _Acc. Depreciation_ is a **contra asset** account that is **increasing. STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD Full-year straight-line depreciation** The straight-line method of depreciation is the simplest and most commonly used. It takes the depreciable base (cost minus residual amount) of the asset and expenses it off evenly over the useful life of the asset. The annual depreciation amount is calculated as follows using straight-line: Cost Resid",
    "ual value Useful life in years The asset is fully depreciated when the years in its useful life have passed. At that point the book value equals the residual value. \n\n\n PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ASSETS IN MORE DETAIL \n\n**EXAMPLE** \n\n On January 1, 2012, a company purchases equipment that costs $27,000. It has a residual value of $900, and has a three-year useful life. The company prepares its financial statements once a year on December 31. \n\n $27,000 $900 = $8,700 per full year 3 \n\n The company purchased the equipment on January 1, 2012, so it can depreciate the asset for the full calendar year. \n\n12/31/12 adjusting entry for depreciation: After the 12/31/12 adjusting entry: \n\n**Date Account Debit Credit** Cost $27,000 \n\n12/31 Depreciation Expense 8,700 Accumulated depreciation 8,700 \n\n Accumulated Depreciation 8,700 Book value $18,300 \n\n12/31/13 adjusting entry for depreciation: After the 12/31/13 adjusting entry: \n\n**Date Account Debit Credit** Cost $27,000 \n\n12/31 Deprecia",

They may only be depreciated for the amount of time during the year that a company owns them. For a partial year, the amount of annual depreciation on December 31 must be pro-rated by the number of months the asset was owned during the year. The following ratios may be used to pro-rate annual depreciation amounts to account for partial-year ownership: \n\n\n PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ASSETS IN MORE DETAIL \n\n Purchase date Months owned as of 12/31 Fraction used to pro-rate annual amount January 12 12/12 February 11 11",

The adjusting entry amount in year 1 is for nine months ($8,700 x 9/12). In years 2 and",
    " 3 the amount is for a full year’s depreciation. In year 4 the adjusting entry amount is for the remaining three months that make up the 36-month, or three-year, useful life ($8,700 x 3/12). \n\n**UNITS OF PRODUCTION METHOD** \n\n The units of production method of depreciation is similar to straight-line except that it uses a rate of usage—such as miles, hours, or units of output—rather than years as the basis for determining the amount of depreciation expense. This method takes the depreciable base (cost minus residual amount) of the asset and expenses it off based on usage during the calendar year. Assume that the unit of usage is machine hours. The depreciation amount per unit of usage is calculated as follows using units of production: \n\n Cost Residual value Useful life in machine hours \n\n The asset is fully depreciated when the machine has been used the number of hours in its useful life. At that point the book value equals the residual value. \n\n**EXAMPLE** \n\n On January 1, 2012, a co",
    "mpany purchases equipment that costs $27,000. It has a residual value of $900, and has an 8,700-hour useful life.

That brings the total number of hours depreciated to 8,700, which is the useful life of the equipment. Be sure not to depreciate more than 8,700 hours. \n\n This same process is followed whether the equipment is owned for a full or partial year. In a partial year, the number o",
    "f hours used will be proportionately fewer to reflect the reduced amount of time available. \n\n**DECLINING BALANCE METHOD** \n\n Full-year declining balance depreciation Declining balance is an accelerated method of depreciation that allows businesses to take more depreciation expense in earlier years and less in later years of the asset’s useful life. \n\n\n PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ASSETS IN MORE DETAIL \n\n The annual depreciation amount using declining balance is calculated by multiplying the asset’s book value at the beginning of the year by a fraction, which is always “2” divided by the number of years in the useful life. This is done for all years except the last year. In the last year, the depreciation amount is the difference between the current book value minus the residual value. This ensures that in the last year you do not depreciate below the residual value. The asset is fully depreciated when the years in its useful life have passed. At that point the book value equals",
    " the residual value. Do not subtract out residual value in the first year (which you do for straight-line.) It is subtracted out instead in the last year. \n\n**EXAMPLE** \n\n On January 1, 2012, a company purchases equipment that costs $27,000. It has a residual value of $900, and has a three-year useful life. The company prepares its financial statements once a year on December 31. \n\n Book Value \n\n**x Rate =** \n\n Amount of Depreciation Expense \n\nYear 1 27,000 x 2/3 = 18,000 \n\n- 18,000 \n\nYear 2 9,000 x 2/3 = 6,000 \n\n- 6,000 \n\nYear 3 3,000 900 = 2,100 \n\n The company purchased the equipment on January 1, 2012, so it can depreciate the asset for the full calendar year. \n\n12/31/12 adjusting entry for depreciation: After the 12/31/12 adjusting entry: \n\n**Date Account Debit Credit** Cost $27,000 \n\n12/31 Depreciation Expense 18,000 Accumulated depreciation 18,000 \n\n Accumulated Depreciation 18,000 Book value $9,000 \n\n12/31/13 adjusting entry for depreciation: After the 12/31/13 adjusting entry: ",

They may only be depreciated for the amount of time during the year that a company owns them. For a partial year, the amount of annual depreciation on December 31 must be pro-rated by the number of months the asset was owned during the year. The same ratios provided for straight-line partial-year depreciation should be used for declining balance. \n\n**EXAMPLE** \n\n On April 1, 2012, a company purchase",

In this case, the company may dispose of the asset. Prior to discussing disposals, the concepts of gain and loss need to be clarified. A gain results when an asset is disposed of in exchange for something of greater value. \n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ASSETS IN MORE DETAIL \n\nGains are increases in the business’s wealth resulting from peripheral activities \n\nunrelated to its main operations. Recall that revenue is earnings a business \n\ngenerates by selling products and/or services to customers in the course of normal \n\nbusiness operations. That is, earnings result from the business doing what it was set \n\nup to do operationally, such as a dry cleaning business cleaning customers’ clothes. \n\nA gain is different in that it results from a transaction outside of the business’s \n\nnormal operations. Althoug",
    "h in terms of debits and credits a gain account is treated \n\nsimilarly to a revenue account, it is maintained in a separate account from revenue. \n\nIn that way the results of gains are not mixed with operations revenues, which \n\nwould make it difficult for companies to track operation profits and losses—a key \n\nelement of gauging a company’s success. \n\nSimilarly, losses are decreases in a business’s wealth due to non-operational \n\ntransactions. Recall that expenses are the costs associated with earning revenues, \n\nwhich is not the case for losses. Although in terms of debits and credits a loss \n\naccount is treated similarly to an expense account, it is maintained in a separate \n\naccount so as not to impact the net income amount from operations. \n\nBoth gains and losses do appear on the income statement, but they are listed \n\nunder a category called “other revenue and expenses” or similar heading. This \n\ncategory appears below the net income from operations line so it is clear that these",
    " \n\ngains and losses are non-operational results. \n\n**4.7.1 Disposal of Fixed Assets** \n\nThere are three ways to dispose of a fixed asset: discard it, sell it, or trade it in. \n\n1. Discard - receive nothing for it \n\n2. Sale - receive cash for it \n\n3. Exchange (trade-in) - receive a similar asset for the original one \n\nThe first step is to determine the book value, or worth, of the asset on the date \n\nof the disposal. **Book value** is determined by subtracting the asset’s Accumulated \n\nDepreciation credit balance from its cost, which is the debit balance of the asset. \n\nNext, compare its book value to the value of what you get for in return for the \n\nasset to determine if you breakeven, have a gain, or have a loss. \n\nThe company breaks even on the disposal of a fixed asset if the cash or trade-in \n\nallowance received is equal to the book value. It also breaks even of an asset with \n\nno remaining book value is discarded and nothing is received in return. \n\nThe company recognizes a gain i",
    "f the cash or trade-in allowance received is \n\ngreater than the book value of the asset. \n\nA loss results from the disposal of a fixed asset if the cash or trade-in allowance \n\nreceived is less than the book value of the asset. The company also experiences a \n\nloss if a fixed asset that still has a book value is discarded and nothing is received \n\nin return. \n\n\n PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ASSETS IN MORE DETAIL \n\n Start the journal entry by crediting the asset for its current debit balance to zero it out. Then debit its accumulated depreciation credit balance set that account balance to zero as well. Build the rest of the journal entry around this beginning. Debit Cash or the new asset if either is received in exchange for the one disposed of, if applicable. Finally, debit any loss or credit any gain that results from a difference between book value and asset received. \n\n**PARTIAL-YEAR DEPRECIATION** \n\n Recall that when a company purchases a fixed asset during a calendar year, i",
    "t must pro-rate the first year’s 12/31 adjusting entry amount for depreciation by the number of months it actually owned the asset. A similar situation arises when a company disposes of a fixed asset during a calendar year. The adjusting entry for depreciation is normally made on 12/31 of each calendar year. If a fixed asset is disposed of during the year, an additional adjusting entry for depreciation on the date of disposal must be journalized to bring the accumulated depreciation balance and book value up to date. \n\n**EXAMPLE** \n\n Equipment that cost $6,000 depreciates $1,200 on 12/31 of each year. Accumulated depreciation on the equipment at the end of the third year is $3,600, and the book value at the end of the third year is $2,400 ($6,000 $3,600). \n\n Scenario #1 The equipment will be disposed of (discarded, sold, or traded in) on 4/1 in the fourth year, which is three months after the last annual adjusting entry was journalized. The first step is to journalize an additional adj",
    "usting entry on 4/1 to capture the additional three months’ depreciation. This ensures that the book value on 4/1 is current. Since the annual depreciation amount is $1,200, the asset depreciates at a rate of $100 a month, for a total of $300. \n\n**Date Account Debit Credit** (^) ▲ _Depreciation Expense_ is an **expense** 4/1 Depreciation Expense 300 account that is **increasing**.

The first step is to journalize an additional adjusting entry on 10/1 to \n\n\n PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ASSETS IN MORE DETAIL \n\n capture the additional nine months’ depreciation.

This must be supplemented by a cash payment and possibly by a loan. The company receives a trade-in allowance for the old asset that may be applied toward the purchase of the new asset. The new asset must be paid for.

Calculate the asset’s book value. \n\n3. Compare the book value to the amount of trade-in allowance received     on the old asset. Determine if there is a gain, loss, or if you break even. \n\n4. Zero out the fixed asset account by crediting it for its current debit     balance. \n\n5. Zero out the **Accumulated Depreciation** account by debiting it     for its current credit balance. \n\n6.

    "n. **4.8 GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE INCOME STATEMENT** Gains and losses are reported on the income statement. However, since they are not transactions that normally occur in the day-to-day operations of a business, they are listed below a new line entitled “Net income from operations.” Net income from operations summarizes revenue and expenses from operational transactions. Gains are added to that amount and losses are deducted to arrive at the final net Income result. Notice how gains and losses are presented on the income statement: \n\n\n PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ASSETS IN MORE DETAIL \n\n Jonick Company Income Statement For the Year Ended December 31, 2012 \n\n Sales $150,000 Cost of merchandise sold 50,000 Gross Profit $100,000 \n\n Operating Expenses Salaries expense $13,000 Rent expense 8,000 Insurance expense 6,000 Supplies expense 5,000 Depreciation expense 3,000 Miscellaneous expense 1,000 Total operating expenses 36,000 Net income from operations $64,000 Gain on sale of invest",

These are therefore called intangible assets and may include patents, copyrights, internet domain names, franchises, trademarks, and goodwill. Patents and copyrights, for example, represent a business’s exclusive right to use or do something that other businesses cannot, at least not without permission. Intangible assets that have finite, or defined useful lives are expensed off over time, similar to fixed assets. This expense for fixed assets is called depreciation; however, for intangible assets it is called amortization. There is no separate contra asset account used when amortizing an intangible asset. Instead, the value of the asset is credited and declines over time. The maximum legal life of a patent is 20 years, but a company can assign a useful period of l",
    "ess than that based on its planned usage. Copyrights and franchises also have specific useful lives. Therefore, these assets may be amortized. The following annual adjusting entry is an example of the amortization of a patent that cost $12,000 to purchase and that has a useful life of 12 years. \n\n**Date Account Debit Credit** (^) ▲ _Amortization Expense_ is an **expense** account 12/31 Amortization Expense 1,000 that is **increasing**. Patents 1,000 ▼ _Patents_ is an **asset** account that is **decreasing**. \n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ASSETS IN MORE DETAIL \n\nInternet domain names and trade names are considered to have infinite useful \n\nlives since they are continuously renewable. Only if a company assigns a specific \n\nusage period to either of these would the intangible asset be amortized. \n\nGoodwill is the most common intangible asset with an indefinite useful life. \n\nGoodwill results only when a business buys another company and pays more \n\nthan the fair value of all of th",
    "e assets and liabilities it acquires. No useful life can \n\nreasonably be determined; therefore, goodwill is not amortized. \n\nThe balances of both fixed and intangible assets are presented in the assets \n\nsection of the balance sheet at the end of each accounting period. When a company \n\nhas a significant number of assets, they are typically presented in categories for \n\nclearer presentation. A financial statement that organizes its asset (and liability) \n\naccounts into categories is called a **classified balance sheet**. \n\nThe partial classified balance sheet that follows shows the assets section only. \n\nNote that there are four sections. **Current assets** itemizes relatively liquid assets \n\nthat will be converted to cash or used within one year. **Long-term assets** presents \n\nfinancial assets that are intended to be held for more than one year. These will be \n\ndiscussed in a later section of this document. **Property, plant and equipment** \n\nlists physical assets with a useful life ",
    "greater than one year, as well as the associated \n\nAccumulated Depreciation account for each fixed asset that is depreciated. The \n\nproperty, plant and equipment category reports the original cost of each fixed \n\nasset, the total amount of that cost that has been expensed off over time to date, \n\nand the resulting book value. **Intangible assets** are then presented. \n\nThe total of asset for each category appears in the far right column of the \n\nclassified balance sheet, and the sum of these totals appears as **total assets**. \n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ASSETS IN MORE DETAIL \n\n Jonick Company Balance Sheet June 30, 2018 \n\n Assets Current assets: Cash $40,000 Accounts receivable $28,000 Less: Allowance for doubtful accounts 3,000 25,000 Merchandise Inventory 60,000 Supplies 18,000 Prepaid Rent 12,000 Total current assets $155,000 \n\n Long-term assets: Investment in equity securities 18,000 \n\n Property, plant and equipment: Equipment $16,000 Less: accumulated depreciation 2,000",

Just like individuals, a company may seek to invest this money",
    " so that \n\nits value grows over time. Rather than placing the cash in checking or savings \n\naccounts in banks, where interest rates are relatively low, companies may choose \n\nto invest in other corporations or government entities for potentially higher rates \n\nof return. \n\nOne option is for the company to invest in **equity securities** , which involves \n\npurchasing stock in other corporations. Equity is actual ownership, and stock can \n\nbe considered a receipt that confirms that ownership. The investor buys a number \n\nof shares of stock at a purchase price per share. The investor becomes a partial \n\nowner of the corporation and is called a stockholder. \n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ASSETS IN MORE DETAIL \n\nThe stock investor may then benefit in two ways. First, the investee (company \n\ninvested in) may pay dividends, which are payouts of profits, to stockholders. \n\nSecondly, the market value per share may increase over time, and the investor may \n\nexperience a gain on the value ",
    "of the shares owned. Although there is not necessarily \n\na guarantee of dividends or appreciation of the value of the shares of stock owned, \n\nthese are the two main incentives that attract companies and individuals to invest \n\nin stock. There is no repayment due date on the ownership of shares of stock. \n\nInvestments in stock may be classified as either short or long-term assets, \n\ndepending on the length of time that the buyer intends to hold the equities. Short\n\nterm stock investments held for less than one year may be called **marketable** \n\n**securities** and appear as a current asset on the investor’s balance sheet. **Long-** \n\n**term investments in stocks** are held for more than one year—often many \n\nyears—by the investing corporation. These are listed in the **Investments** section \n\nof the firm’s balance sheet. \n\nA second investment choice for the company is **debt securities** , such as \n\ncorporate or governmental **bonds**. Bonds are loans made collectively by smaller \n\nlen",
    "ders, such as other corporations and individual people, to a corporation. The \n\npeople or companies who invest in corporate bonds are called **bondholders**. They \n\ndo not become owners of a corporation like stockholders do; they are just lenders. \n\nBondholders lend their money to corporations in order to be paid interest on \n\nthe loan amount throughout the number of years in the term of the bond. Interest \n\non corporate bonds is often paid semi-annually—every six months. On the maturity \n\ndate, bondholders are repaid the original amount that they loaned the corporation. \n\nInvestments in bonds may be classified as either short or long-term assets, \n\ndepending on the length of time that the buyer intends to hold the investment. \n\nShort-term bond investments held for less than one year may be called **marketable** \n\n**securities** or **trading securities** and appear as a current asset on the investor’s \n\nbalance sheet. **Long-term investments in bonds** are held for more than one \n\nyear",
    "—usually many years—by the investing corporation. These are listed in the \n\nInvestment section of the firm’s balance sheet for most of their life and only become \n\ncurrent assets within one year of their maturity date. Long-term investments in \n\nbonds are classified as either **held-to-maturity** or **available-for-sale** securities, \n\nwhich will be explained in the following section. \n\nCertain types of stock and bond investments may be sold at breakeven, at \n\na gain, or at a loss, similar to the sale of fixed assets. Again, it is important to \n\nnote that any gain or loss is incurred on an investment transaction is outside of \n\nwhat occurs in normal business operations. When a gain or loss on the sale of \n\nan investment is recognized in the same transaction as the receipt of cash, it is \n\nconsidered a **realized** gain or loss, because it occurs only at the time of the sale \n\nand is based on the amount of cash received. \n\nOther types of stock and bond investments are adjusted to fair v",
    "alue, or the \n\ncurrent trading price on the open market, throughout the time they are owned by \n\nthe investor.

A separate account that mentions the unique name of the corporation for each stock investment is used. For example, a company might invest in the stock of three other corporations and use _Investment in ABC Stock, Investment in Home Depot Stock,_ and _Investment in Delta Airlines Stock_ as their three distinct asset account names. (On the balance sheet, these individual investment accounts may be combined in the _Marketable S",
    "ecurities_ listing for short-term investments and/or the _Equities Securities_ listing for long-term investments for an efficient presentation.) \n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ASSETS IN MORE DETAIL \n\nThere are five possible journal entries related to investing in stock, as follows: \n\n1. Purchase the stock investment \n\n2. Receive dividend payments \n\n3. Recognize net income of the issuing corporation \n\n4. Adjust to fair value \n\n5. Sell the stock investment \n\nEach stock investment is accounted for using one of two methods, either the \n\n**fair value through net income method** or the **equity method**. The choice for \n\neach investment depends on the percentage of another corporation’s outstanding \n\nshares that the investing company purchases. \n\nIf a company purchases **less than 20%** of another corporation’s outstanding \n\nshares, the **fair value through net income method** is used. Investors who \n\nown less than 20% of the outstanding shares are not considered to have significant \n",
    "\ninfluence over the company they are investing in. An example would be the purchase \n\nof 1,000 shares of another corporation that has 100,000 shares outstanding. The \n\ninvestor owns only 1% (1,000 / 100,000). \n\nIf a company purchases **between 20% and 50%** of another corporation’s \n\noutstanding shares, the **equity method** is used. Investors who own between 20% \n\nand 50% of the outstanding shares are considered to have significant influence over \n\nthe company they are investing in. An example would be the purchase of 40,000 \n\nshares of another corporation that has 100,000 shares outstanding. The investor \n\nowns 40% (40,000 / 100,000). \n\nThe purchase of more than 50% of another corporation’s outstanding shares is \n\nconsidered a consolidation and will not be discussed. \n\nTwo versions of the five journal entries related to investing in stock are \n\nillustrated side by side in the journal entries that follow.

    "erence between the fair value through net income and equity methods is seen when the issuing corporation pays cash dividends. \n\n Fair value through net income method Under the fair value through net income method, the investor simply reports dividend receipts as revenue. The Dividends Revenue account is credited. \n\n Equity method Under the equity method, dividend receipts are reported as a reduction of the investment account.

RECOGNIZE NET INCOME OF THE ISSUING CORPORATION** \n\n Another difference between the fair value through net income and equity methods is seen when the issuing corporati",
    "on reports net income. \n\n Fair value through net income method There is no journal entry under the fair value through net income method, where the percentage of investor ownership is not considered significant enough to participate in the issuing company’s earnings. \n\n Equity method Under the equity method, the investing corporation owns such a significant percentage of the issuing corporation’s shares that it actually takes ownership of its percentage of the issuing corporation’s net income and reports it as its own. In this case, Your Corporation owns 25% of ABC Corporation’s outstanding shares, so it recognizes 25% of ABC Corporation’s net income ($100,000 x 25% = $25,000). This results in an increase in the value of the investment account as well. \n\n\n PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ASSETS IN MORE DETAIL \n\n FAIR VALUE THROUGH NET INCOME method EQUITY method \n\nABC Corporation reports net income of $100,000.

ADJUST TO FAIR VALUE** \n\n Fair value through net income method A third difference between the two methods is that the carrying value of the investment under the fair value through net income method must be adjusted to fair value at the end of each ac",
    "counting period. Fair value is the current trading price of the stock on the market, which is readily available for public corporations in financial newspapers and online sites. For investments that involve less than 20% of the issuing corporation’s outstanding stock, a gain or loss is recorded if fair value is different than carrying value. However, it is an unrealized gain or loss since the investment has not yet been sold and there are no cash proceeds yet. The investment account is debited if the fair value increases, and an unrealized gain is recognized by crediting the Unrealized Holding Gain/Loss – Net Income account. These accounts in the journal entry are reversed and an unrealized loss results if the fair value of the investment declines. The Unrealized Holding Gain/Loss – Net Income account appears on the income statement under a category heading called other comprehensive income section, after the net income line.

    "WNERSHIP (FAIR VALUE THROUGH NET INCOME METHOD) \n\n The Unrealized Holding Gain/Loss – Net Income account appears on the income statement as part of other comprehensive income. It represents the amount of gain or loss on investments that have not yet been sold, but whose fair value has changed since their initial cost. A fair value greater than cost represents an unrealized gain; a fair value less than cost represents an unrealized loss. The Unrealized Holding Gain/Loss – Net Income account is adjusted over time, particularly before financial statements are prepared, to update the unrealized gain or loss amount based on the most current fair value. The Gain on Sale of Investment and Loss on Sale of Investment accounts that represent actual gains and losses from the sale of investments are not used for stock investments that are less than 20% of outstanding shares.

An investor in bonds is lending money to another corporation. A separate account that mentions the unique name of the corporation for each bond investment is used. \n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ASSETS IN MORE DETAIL \n\nFor example, a company might invest in the bonds of three other corporations and \n\nuse _Investment in ABC Bonds, Investment in Home Depot Bo",
    "nds,_ and _Investment_ \n\n_in Delta Airlines Bonds_ as their three distinct asset account names. \n\nThere are five possible journal entries related to investing in bonds, as follows: \n\n1. Purchase the bonds investment \n\n2. Record the semi-annual interest receipts \n\n3. Amortize the discount or premium \n\n4. Adjust to fair value \n\n5. Sell the bonds investment \n\nInvestments in bonds are accounted for in three different ways, depending on \n\nhow long the investor intends to hold the investment. Bonds are classified as one \n\nof three types of securities. \n\nThe debt is classified as (a) **held-to-maturity** when the investor has the intent \n\nand ability to hold the bond full term. \n\nThe debt is classified as (b) **trading** when the intent is to sell it in the short \n\nterm for profit and own it less than one year. \n\nThe debt is classified as (c) **available-for-sale** when it is neither held-to\n\nmaturity nor trading. \n\nThe investment in bonds accounts appear in the assets section of the balance ",
    "\n\nsheet. Those that are classified as trading securities to be sold or traded within \n\none year are current assets. Held-to-maturity and available-for-sale securities that \n\nare intended to be owned for more than one year are categorized as long-term \n\ninvestments. \n\nBonds have a face value, which is the amount that will be repaid on the maturity \n\ndate. In the example that follows, the face amount is $5,000,000. In addition, the \n\nbond investment will show a contract rate, which is the percent of interest that will \n\nbe paid annually to investors. In the example, the interest rate is 8%. Bonds also \n\nare in effect for a stated period of time and have a maturity date. In the example, \n\nthe term of the bonds is four years, so the maturity date is December 31, 2021. On \n\nthat date, investors are repaid the face amount of the bond investment. \n\n**4.10.1 Held-to-Maturity Securities** \n\nBond investments are classified as held-to-maturity when the investor has the \n\nintent and ability to hol",

Explanations are included. \n\n\n PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ASSETS IN MORE DETAIL \n\n Held-to-maturity bond securities appear under the Long-Term Investments caption in the assets section of the balance sheet. They are reported at their amortized cost, as explained below. They are not adjusted to fair value. \n\n 1A. PURCHASE THE BOND INVESTMENT OF HELD-TO-MATURITY SECURITIES \n\n Bonds may be purchased for their face amount. They may also be purchased at either a discount or a premium; that is, for less or more than the face amount, respectively. If the contract interest rate that the issuing corporation is offering is less than the goi",
    "ng market rate, investors purchase the bonds at a discount (for less than face amount). If the contract interest rate that the issuing corporation is offering is more than the going market rate, investors purchase the bonds at a premium (for more than face amount). The following bonds are purchased on January 1, 2018. \n\n At a Discount (market rate is lower) At a Premium (market rate is higher) \n\n1/1/2018 Your Corporation purchases $5,000,000 of four-year, 6% ABC Co. bonds for $4,700,000.

RECORD INTEREST FOR SEMI-ANNUAL INTEREST RECEIPTS FOR HELD-TO-MATURITY SECURITIES \n\n The corporation that issued the bond securities pays interest to the investor semi-annually, or every six months. The issuing company pays semi-annual interest on June 30 and December 31 each year. The amount is determined by multiplying the face amount of the bonds by half of the annual contract rate. \n\n\n PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ASSETS IN MORE DETAIL \n\n At a Discount (market rate is lower) At a Premium (market rate is higher) EVERY SIX MONTHS Your Corporation records semiannual interest received and discount amortized. \n\n EVERY SIX MONTHS Yo",

This transaction is recorded every six months as the cash is received for the interest revenue for as long as the investment is held. \n\n 3A. AMORTIZATION OF DISCOUNT OR PREMIUM FOR HELD-TOMATURITY SECURITIES JUST PRIOR TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\n If bonds are purchased at a discount or premium, there is a difference between the amount paid for the investment a",
    "nd the face amount. That difference is accounted for over time as Interest Revenue rather than recorded as Interest Revenue all at once at the time of purchase. This process is called amortization; it is similar to depreciation but for non-physical assets. Assume that the investor prepares financial statements at the end of each calendar year. The straight-line method will be used to amortize the discount or premium amount at the end of each year, which involves dividing the discount or premium amount by the number of years in the term of the bond. \n\n\n PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ASSETS IN MORE DETAIL \n\n At a Discount (market rate is lower) At a Premium (market rate is higher) \n\nEVERY YEAR END Your Corporation records semi-annual interest received and discount amortized. \n\n EVERY YEAR END Your Corporation records semi-annual interest received and premium amortized. \n\n Account Debit Credit \n\n ▲ Investment in ABC Bonds 75,000 \n\n ▲ Investment Revenue 75,000 \n\n Account Debit Credit ",

Assuming that the investing corporation prepares annual financial statements on December 31 each calendar year, the corporation may need to pro-rate the amounts received for semi-annual interest and amounts amortized to adjust for a partial year of ownership.

These notes will provide a simplified discussion of payroll and payroll \n\ntaxes. There can be many variations, exceptions, and complexities. However, \n\nknowing the basic elements is a very good start to understanding payroll. \n\nA **salary** is typically an amount an employee earns annually, such as $52,000 \n\nper year. \n\nA **wage** is typically an amount an employee earns hourly, such as $10 per hour. \n\nThe hourl",
    "y rate is then multiplied by the number of hours in the pay period to \n\ndetermine total earnings for that period. \n\nA **pay period** is the span of time that is included in each paycheck that an \n\nemployee receives. Typical pay periods are weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly, \n\nand monthly. \n\n**Gross pay** is the amount that an employee earns in a pay period before any \n\npayroll taxes or other deductions are subtracted. EXAMPLES: (1) The gross pay \n\nof an employee who is paid weekly and who earns $52,000 per year is $1,000 per \n\nweek. (2) The gross pay of an employee who is paid weekly and who earns $10 per \n\nhour for a 40-hour work week is $400 per week. \n\nEmployees are required by law to have certain taxes withheld (taken out) of \n\ntheir gross pay as they earn it. Therefore, rather than receiving the entire amount \n\nof their gross pay in each paycheck, they receive less. Employers are required by \n\nlaw to withhold these taxes from an employee’s gross pay and then pay them to \n\nfederal an",
    "d state government agencies on the employee’s behalf. \n\nEmployees in the state of Georgia typically must pay the following taxes, which \n\nare withheld from their gross pay: \n\n How much? What for? \n\n Federal income tax Use IRS tax tables Needs of the population in the UnitedStates \n\n Social Security tax 6.2% of gross pay Monthly income when employee reaches retirement age \n\n Medicare tax 1.45% of gross pay \n\n Health insurance benefits when employee reaches retirement age \n\n Georgia State income tax Use GA Dept. ofRevenue tax tables Needs of the population in the State ofGeorgia \n\nThe federal and state governments provide tax tables so an employee’s \n\nwithholding tax amount can simply be looked up.

Next, look down the first two columns on the page and locate the row in which the employee’s gross pay amount would fall. Finally, look across the row and locate the amount that falls under the number of allowances that the employee has claimed. Net pay is the amount of cash the employee receives in his/her paycheck. It is gross pay minus taxes withheld. \n\n**Gross pay Federal income tax Social Security tax Medicare tax State tax = Net pay** \n\n\n PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING LIABILITIES IN MORE DETAIL \n\n**EXAMPLE** \n\n ",

A note payable is a loan contract that specifies the principal (amount of the loan), the interest rate stated as an annual percentage, and the terms stated in number of days, months, or years. A note payable may be either short term (less than one year) or long term (more than one year). **5.3.1 Short-Term Note Payable** Loans may be short term, due to be repaid by the business within one year. These are current liabilities. There are two types of short-term notes payable: interest bearing and discounted. The difference lies basically in when the borrower pays the interest to the lender.

One way to do this is to issue stock. Investors contribute \n\ncash to the business and are issued stock in return to recognize their shares of \n\nownership. \n\nAnother alternative for raising cash is to borrow the money and to pay it back \n\nat a future date. Banks and other traditional lending sources are one option where \n\nthe corporation may go to take out a loan for the full amount needed. \n\nAnother possibility is for the corporation to issue bonds, which are also a form \n\nof debt. **Bonds** are loans made by smaller lenders, such as other corporations \n\nand individual people. Corporate bonds are usually issued in $1,000 increments. \n\nA corporation may borrow from many different smaller investors and collectively \n\nraise the a",
    "mount of cash it needs. Corporate bonds are traded on the bond market \n\nsimilar to the way corporate stock is traded on the stock market. They are long\n\nterm liabilities for most of their life and only become current liabilities as of one \n\nyear before their maturity date. \n\nThe people or companies who purchase bonds from a corporation are called \n\nbondholders, and they are essentially lending their money as an investment. The \n\nreason bondholders lend their money is because they are paid interest by the \n\ncorporation on the amount they lend throughout the term of the bond. Bondholders \n\ndo not become owners of a corporation like stockholders do. \n\nA **bond** is a loan contract, called a **debenture,** which spells out the terms \n\nand conditions of the loan agreement. At the very least, the debenture states the \n\nface amount of the bond, the interest rate, and the term. The **face amount** is the \n\namount that the bondholder is lending to the corporation. The **contract rate of** \n\n**i",
    "nterest** is similar to a rental fee that the corporation commits to pay for use of the \n\nlenders’ money. It is quoted as an annual percentage, such as 6% per year. Finally, \n\nthe **term** is the number of years that the bond covers. The **maturity date** is the \n\ndate that the corporation must pay back the full face amount to the bondholders. \n\nNone of the face amount of the bond is repaid before the maturity date. \n\nThere is one other important number to look for: the **market rate of interest**. \n\nThink of it as the interest rate that the competition (other corporations) is offering \n\nto the same prospective investors. It may be the same, higher, or lower than an \n\nissuing corporation’s contract interest rate. \n\n\n PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING LIABILITIES IN MORE DETAIL \n\n**EXAMPLE** \n\n**A corporation’s contract rate is 8%.** \n\n The market rate is 8%. The contract rate is equal to the market rate. The market rate is 6%. The contract rate is more than the market rate. The market",

Paying semi-annual interest - recording the expense of paying     bondholders the contract interest rate every six months \n\n3. Amortizing the discount or premium - recording the expense or revenue     associated with issuing a bond below or above face amount \n\n4. Redeeming the bond - paying back the bondholders on or before the     maturity date of the bond \n\n Besides keeping a running balance of each of the new accounts, the key number to determine is the carrying amount of a bond at any point in time. This is the bond’s book value, or what it is worth at the moment. \n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING LIABILITIES IN MORE DETAIL \n\n**5.4.1 Bond Transactions When Contract Rate Equals** \n\n**Market Rate** \n\nA corporation may borrow money by issuing bonds. In return the corporation \n\nwill pay the bondholders i",

    "\n\n▲ _Bonds Payable_ is a **liability** account that is **increasing**. \n\n**Paying semi-annual interest** \n\nA corporation typically pays interest to bondholders semi-annually, which is \n\ntwice per year.

As a result, your corporation’s \n\nsemi-annual interest payments will be lower than what investors could receive \n\nelsewhere. To be competitive and still attract investors, the bond must be issued at \n\na **discount**. This means the corporation receives less cash than the face amount of \n\nthe bond when it issues the bond. This difference is the discount.

As a result, the corporation will pay out \n\n$55,000 in interest over the five-year term. Comparable bonds on the market will \n\npay out $60,000 over this same time frame. This is a difference of $5,000 over \n\nten years. \n\nTo compensate for the fact that the corporation will pay out $5,000 less in \n\ninterest, it will charge investors $5,000 less to purchase the bonds and collect \n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING LIABILITIES IN MORE DETAIL \n\n$95,000 instead of $100,000.

    " Another incentive car manufacturers may offer is a rebate, which is an up-front reduction off the purchase price, similar to a coupon for a food purchase. If a manufacturer offers both zero-percent interest and a rebate, the car buyer can choose one or the other—but not both. Guess what—both deals are probably about equal in terms of savings. So why would both be offered? Because some people will be attracted to buy because of lower payments over time and others will be interested due to the lower upfront purchase price. The deals are designed to appeal to different types of people with different buying preferences. It is similar with bonds. Some investors prefer to pay full price and have higher interest payments every six months. Others are attracted by paying less up front and being paid back the full face amount at maturity and are willing to live with the lower semi-annual interest payments. Both deals are equal in value but are structured to appeal to different markets. \n\n\nPRINC",

Amortizing the discount** \n\nThe corporation issued the bond January 1 at a $3,679 discount: it received \n\n$96,321 in cash on the issue date but will pay back $100,000 on the maturity date. \n\nThat $3,679 difference is a cost of doing business for this company. Instead of \n\nclaiming this entire discount amount as interest expense when the bond is issued, \n\nthe company records it in the _Discount on Bonds Payable_ account. \n\nAt the end of each year, the corporation will make an adjusting entry that \n\namortizes the discount, or expenses part of it off.

This is the 11 th^ payment by the corporation to the bondholders. \n\n ▼ Bonds Payable is a liability account that is decreasing. ▼ Cash is an asset account that is decreasing. \n\n After five years the Discount on Bonds Payable account has a zero balance, so nothing needs to be done with this account at this time. \n\n**5.4.3 Carrying Amount of B",
    "onds Issued at a Discount** \n\n The carrying amount can be thought of as “what the bond is worth” at a given point in time. Initially, the carrying amount is the amount of cash received when the bond is issued. \n\nCalculate the carrying amount as follows: \n\n_Bonds Payable_ credit balance _Discount on Bonds Payable_ debit balance = Carrying amount \n\n Each year the discount is amortized, the carrying amount changes. The Discount on Bonds Payable debit balance decreases, so the carrying amount increases and gets closer and closer to the face amount over time.

This is the \n\nbond’s book value, or what it is worth at the moment. \n\n**5.4.4 Bond Transactions When Contract Rate is More Than** \n\n**Market Rate** \n\nThere are times when the contract rate that your corporation will pay is **more** \n\nthan the market rate that other corporations will pay. As a result, your corporation’s \n\nsemi-a",
    "nnual interest payments will be higher than what investors could receive \n\nelsewhere. Since its future interest payments will be higher in comparison to other \n\nbonds on the market, the corporation can command a higher amount up front \n\nwhen the bond is issued, and the bond is sold at a **premium**. This means the \n\ncorporation receives more cash than the face amount of the bond when it issues the \n\nbond. This difference is the premium. The corporation still pays the face amount \n\nback to the bondholders on the maturity date. \n\n**EXAMPLE** \n\n**$100,000 of five-year, 12% bonds when the market rate was 11%.** \n\nHere is a comparison of the 10 interest payments if a company’s contract rate \n\n**is more than** the market rate. \n\n Corporation (pays 12% interest) Market (pays 11% interest) \n\n $6,000 every six months x 10 semi-annual payments $60,000 over the five-year period \n\n $5,500 every six months x 10 semi-annual payments $55,000 over the five-year period \n\nIn this case, the corporation i",
    "s offering a 12% interest rate, or a payment of \n\n$6,000 every six months, when other companies are offering an 11% interest rate, \n\nor a payment of $5,500 every six months. As a result, the corporation will pay out \n\n$60,000 in interest over the five-year term. Comparable bonds on the market will \n\npay out $55,000 over this same time frame. This is a difference of $5,000 over \n\nfive years. \n\nTo compensate for the fact that the corporation will pay out $5,000 more in \n\ninterest, it will charge investors $5,000 more to purchase the bonds and will collect \n\n$105,000 instead of $100,000. This is essentially collecting the $5,000 difference \n\nin interest up front from investors and essentially using it to pay them the higher \n\ninterest rate over time. The corporation will still pay bondholders the $100,000 \n\nface amount at the end of the five-year term. \n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING LIABILITIES IN MORE DETAIL \n\nThere are four journal entries that relate to bonds that are issued at ",

The premium amount is divided \n\nby the number of years in the term of the bond, and that amount is removed from \n\nthe _Premium on Bonds Payable_ account and recorded an _Interest Expense_ (as a \n\ncredit, similar to recognizing it as revenue.) Amortization is similar to depreciation \n\nin terms of expensing a transaction off over time; it applies to an intangible rather \n\nthan a physical product. \n\nIn this case, the $3,769 premium is divided by 5, the number of years of the \n\nterm of the bond, resulting in $754 per year (rounded to the nearest dollar.)

Not all bonds are callable; this must be a stipulation in the bond contract. The conditions of the contract will also determine how much the bond will be called for: exactly face amount, less than face amount, or more than face amount. \n\n1. The company may pay bondholders the face amount of $100,000. \n\n2. The company may call the bonds for less than face amount and, for     example, pay bondholders $99,000 for a $100,000 bond. This could     also be worded as “called the bond at 99,” which means 99% of the face     amount. \n\n3. The company may call the bonds for more than face amount and, for     exa",
    "mple, pay bondholders $102,000 for a $100,000 bond.

As with the sale \n\nof fixed assets or investments, it is important to note that any gain or loss when \n\nbonds are repaid early is incurred on a transaction that is outside of what occurs in \n\nnormal business operations. \n\nIf a corporation redeems a bond prior to its maturity date, the carrying amount \n\nat the time should be compared to the amount of cash the issuing company must \n\npay to call the bond. If the corporation pays **more** cash than what the bond is \n\nworth (the carrying amount), it experiences a **loss**. If it pays **less** cash than the \n\nbond’s carrying amount, there is a **gain**. \n\nIt is important to note that a gain or loss is incurred on a transaction that \n\nis outside of what occurs in normal business operations and therefore is not \n\ncategorized as an operating revenue or expense. \n\nA loss is similar to an expense, except it involves a transaction that is not directly \n\nrelated to the business’ operations. A gain is similar to revenue. It t",
    "oo involves a \n\nnon-operational transaction. Redeeming bonds is not a corporation’s primary line \n\nof business, so these transactions are non-operational. \n\n**ANALOGY** \n\n Let’s say you purchase an airline ticket from Atlanta to San Francisco for $400. While in flight, you learn that the person sitting next to you paid $250 for the same flight. You would probably feel badly and a little cheated for having paid too much. That is similar to paying more than carrying amount to redeem a bond, and that is a loss. On the flip side, you would feel pretty pleased if you were the one who paid $250 rather than the other passenger’s $400 fare. That is similar to a gain on redemption of bonds, when you pay less than carrying amount to redeem a bond. \n\n\n PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING LIABILITIES IN MORE DETAIL \n\n The following four examples show bonds at both a discount and a premium that are called at both a gain and a loss. \n\n**EXAMPLE 1** \n\n**Bond issued at a discount, called at a loss** \n\n",

    " \n\nof each calendar year, it will be necessary to pro-rate the amortization amount to \n\nproperly reflect the time during the year that the bond was held. \n\n**EXAMPLE 1** \n\n**Issuing bonds mid-year** \n\nA five-year bond is issued on April 1, 2012 at a $60,000 premium. \n\nThe premium is $12,000 per year, or $1,000 per month. \n\nThe adjusting entry to amortize the premium on December 31, 2012 is as follows: \n\n**Account Debit Credit** (^) The bond was held for 9 months in 2012, so the amount amortized is $9,000 (1,000 x 9). ▲ Premium on Bonds Payable 9,000 ▼ Interest Expense 9,000 **EXAMPLE 2 Redeeming bonds mid-year** A five-year bond is redeemed on April 1, 2012 at a $60,000 discount.

However, if a bond is redeemed mid-year, an adjusting entry is recorded to bring the carrying up to date as of the date of redemption. **5.4.8 Partial Redemptions** It is possible for a corporation to redeem only some of the bonds that it holds. **EXAMPLE 3** Bonds Payable credit balance = $600,000 Discount on Bonds Payable debit balance = $30,000 One-third of the bonds are redeemed for $195,000 \n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING LIABILITIES IN MORE DETAIL \n\n Account Debit Credit ▼ Bonds Payable 200,000 600,000 / 3 \n\n ▲ Loss on Redemption of Bonds 5,000 195,000 (200,000 10,000) \n\n ▼ Discount on Bonds Payable 10,000 30,000 / 3 ▼ Cash 195,000 Given \n\nThe balances of both current and long-term liabilities are presented in the \n\nliabilities section of the balance sheet at the end of each accounting period.

It must be in balance at all times. It involves the three types of accounts that appear on the balance sheet. The accounting equation is Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders’ Equity. The corporation has assets, and it must pay for these assets. It can do so in two ways. The corporation can use its own money or it can borrow and use other people’s money, incurring liabilities, or debts. Indirectly, revenue and expense accounts are part of this accounting equation since they impact the value of stockholders’ equity through closing entries, which move revenue and expense account balances into Retained Earnings. \n\n**Common Stock + Retained Earnings = Total Stockholders’ Equity** \n\n ACCOUNTING EQUATION: Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders’ Equity / \\ Common Stock Retained Earnin",
    "gs / \\ Revenue Expenses \n\n Retained earnings is a company’s accumulated profit since it began operations minus any dividends distributed over that time. Stockholders’ equity (account category) is the amount of a business’s total assets that is owned by the stockholders. Two accounts that you know so far fall in this category: stockholders’ equity is the total of the balances in the Common Stock and Retained Earnings accounts. Common Stock (account) is the ownership value in the business that comes from outside the company investors put their own money into the business. Retained Earnings (account) is the ownership value in the business that comes from inside the company the business makes a profit that is shared by its stockholders. Dividends (account) are distributions of profits from Retained Earnings to stockholders. \n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY IN MORE DETAIL \n\nAny change in the _Common Stock_ , _Retained Earnings_ , or _Dividends_ accounts \n\naffects t",
    "otal stockholders’ equity. \n\nStockholders’ Equity can _increase_ in two ways: \n\n1. Stock is issued and Common Stock increases _and/or_ \n\n2. Business makes a profit and Retained Earnings increases \n\nStockholders’ Equity can _decrease_ in two ways: \n\n1. Dividends are distributed and Retained Earnings decreases _and/or_ \n\n2. Business takes a loss and Retained Earnings decreases \n\n**6.2 CORPORATIONS AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY** \n\nA **corporation** is a form of business organization that is a **separate legal** \n\n**entity** ; it is distinct from the people who own it. The corporation can own property, \n\nenter into contracts, borrow money, conduct business, earn profit, pay taxes, and \n\nmake investments similar to the way individuals can. \n\nThe **owners** of a corporation are called **stockholders**. These are people \n\nwho have invested cash or contributed other assets to the business. In return, \n\nthey receive **shares of stock** , which are transferable units of ownership in a \n\ncorporation.",
    " Stock can also be thought of as a receipt to acknowledge ownership in \n\nthe company. The value of the stock that a stockholder receives equals the value of \n\nthe asset(s) that were contributed. \n\nA corporation may be owned by one stockholder or by millions. Very small \n\ncompanies can incorporate by filing articles of incorporation with a state in the \n\nU.S. and being granted corporate status. \n\nCorporations are **ongoing**. Stockholders can buy and sell their shares of stock \n\nwithout interrupting the operation of the company. Another characteristic of a \n\ncorporation is **limited liability**. Stockholders can lose no more than the amount \n\nthey invested in the corporation. If the corporation fails, the individuals who own \n\nit do not personally have to cover the corporation’s liabilities. \n\nUp to this point, the stockholders’ equity section of the balance sheet has \n\nincluded two accounts: _Common Stock_ and _Retained Earnings_. Common Stock \n\nis value that the owners have in the bus",
    "iness because they have contributed their \n\nown personal assets. Retained earnings is value the owners have in the corporation \n\nbecause the business has been operating – doing what it was set up to do and as \n\na result it has generated a profit that the owners share. It is preferable, of course, \n\nfor stockholder wealth to increase due to net income over time. That earnings \n\npotential is, in fact, what attracts stockholders to invest their own money into a \n\nbusiness in the first place. \n\nThe following Accounts Summary Table summarizes the accounts relevant to \n\nissuing stock. \n\n\n PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY IN MORE DETAIL \n\n ACCOUNTS SUMMARY TABLE ACCOUNT TYPE ACCOUNTS^ \n\n TO INCREASE \n\n TO DECREASE \n\n NORMAL BALANCE \n\n FINANCIAL STATEMENT \n\n CLOSE OUT? \n\nAsset Organization Costs debit credit debit BalanceSheet NO \n\nLiability Cash Dividends Payable credit debit credit Balance Sheet \n\n NO \n\nStockholders’ Equity \n\n Common Stock (CS) Paid-in Capital in Exces",

The point of these journal entries is to ultimately arrive at one number: total stockholders’ equity. Owners of a business are very interested in knowing what they are worth, and that final result is the answer to that question. The new material we will cover next involves the stockholders’ equity section of the balan",

The generic Common Stock account will no longer be the only account used for owner investments: six new accounts will be added that describe a corporation’s equity in more specific detail.

The total value of these seven account balances is called paid-in capital. Total paid-in capital plus Retained Earnings , which is still used to keep a running balance of a company’s accumulated profit on hand, equals total stockholders’ equity. Shares authorized is the number of shares a corporation is allowed to issue (sell). For a large corporation this is based on a decision by its Board of Directors, a group elected to represent and serve the interest of the stockholders. Authorization is just permission to sell shares of stock; no action has actually taken place yet. Therefore, there is no jo",
    "urnal entry for a stock authorization. Shares issued is the number of shares a corporation has sold to stockholders for the first time. The number of shares issued cannot exceed the number of shares authorized. \n\n**6.3 ISSUING STOCK FOR CASH** \n\n A corporation may issue stock to raise money. “Issue” means to sell the shares of stock for the first time. If the company issues only one type of stock, it is common stock. The investors become owners of the company and are called stockholders. A journal entry must be recorded when a corporation issues stock. \n\n**1. Issued 15,000 shares of $10 par common stock for $10 per share.** \n\n Account Debit Credit ▲ Cash 150,000 (15,000 x $10)^ -^ Cash received \n\n ▲ Common Stock 150,000 (15,000 x $10)^ -^ Stock issued at par value \n\n The terms above may be better understood with an analogy to a credit card. If you are approved for a credit card, the terms will include a credit limit, such as $5,000, which is the maximum that you are allowed to charge o",
    "n the card. This is similar to “shares authorized,” the maximum number of shares a company is allowed to issue. The credit limit on a card does not mean that you have to charge $5,000 on your first purchase, but instead that you may continue to charge purchases up until you have reached a $5,000 maximum. The same holds true for shares issued. Smaller numbers of shares may be sold over time up to the maximum of the number of shares authorized. If you wish to charge more than your credit limit on a credit card, you may contact the company that issued the card and request an increase in your credit limit. They may or may not grant this request. The same is true for a corporation. If it wishes to issue more shares than the number authorized, it may approach the Board of Directors with this request. \n\n\n PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY IN MORE DETAIL \n\n Par value is an amount assigned to each share of stock when it is authorized.

This time Preferred Stock and Paid-in Capital in Excess of Par Preferred Stock are credited instead of the accounts for common stock. \n\n ▲ Cash is an asset account that is increasing. ▲ Preferred Stock is a stockholders’ equity account that is increasing. ▲ Paid-in Capital in Excess of Par Preferred Stock is a stockholders’ equity account that is increasing. \n\n\n PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY IN MORE DETAIL \n\n Information about preferred stock might also be",
    " presented in one of the following two ways: \n\n Example 1: A corporation issues 1,000 shares of $1 preferred, $100 par stock for $105 per share. \n\n Example 2: A corporation issues 1,000 shares of 1% preferred, $100 par stock for $105 per share. \n\n The extra dollar or percentage information given relates to the cash dividend amount per share on the preferred stock. It may be stated directly as a dollar amount, such as $1. It may also be stated as a percentage, such as 1% of the par value of $100, which also results in $1 per share. This $1 or 1% is not a factor in the journal entry for issuing the preferred stock. \n\n**6.4 ISSUING STOCK FOR NON-CASH ASSETS** \n\n Stock may be issued for assets other than cash, such as services rendered, land, equipment, vehicles, accounts receivable, and inventory. This is more common in small corporations than in larger ones. The journal entries are similar to those for issuing stock for cash. In this case, the value of either the stock or the asset must ",
    "be known. The assumption is that both the asset and the stock have the same value. \n\n**1. Issued 10,000 shares of $20 par common stock for land.

The corporation is buying back its own stock from the stockholders. Since treasury stock shares are no longer owned by stockholders, but by the corporation itself, total stockholders’ equity decreases. \n\n\n PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STOCKHOLDERS",
    "’ EQUITY IN MORE DETAIL \n\n Shares outstanding equals the number of shares issued (sold for the first time) minus the number of shares of treasury stock a corporation has reacquired. When treasury stock is purchased, the number of shares issued remains unchanged, but the number of shares outstanding decreases. When treasury stock is purchased, the Treasury Stock account is debited for the number of shares purchased times the purchase price per share. Treasury Stock is a contra stockholders’ equity account and increases by debiting. It is not an asset account. Treasury stock may be resold to stockholders at the same, a higher, or a lower price than it was purchased for. When sold, the Treasury Stock account can only be credited in multiples of its original purchase price per share. Use the Paid-in Capital from Sale of Treasury Stock account for differences between purchase and selling prices. Paid-in Capital from Sale of Treasury Stock is credited for any amount above the original purcha",
    "se price (similar to a gain) and is debited for any amount below the original purchase price (similar to a loss). The sale of treasury stock increases the number of shares outstanding and increases total stockholders’ equity. The par value of the stock is not a factor in the purchase or sale of treasury stock. \n\n**EXAMPLE** \n\n Assume there were 10,000 shares of common stock issued before any treasury stock transaction. That would mean there were also 10,000 shares outstanding. \n\n**1.

    "re ($45). The $15 per share difference is recorded as a credit to the Paid-in Capital from Sale of Treasury Stock account. Selling treasury stock increases the number of shares outstanding (the number of shares stockholders own). Prior to selling these 200 shares of treasury stock there were 9,000 shares of common stock outstanding (see #1). After selling these shares of treasury stock, there are 9,200 shares outstanding. \n\n ▲ Cash is an asset account that is increasing. ▲ Paid-in Capital from Sale of Treasury Stock is a stockholders’ equity account that is increasing. ▼ Treasury Stock is a contra stockholders’ equity account that is decreasing. \n\n Treasury stock may be resold to stockholders for less than its purchase price per share. \n\n**3.

    " DIVIDENDS** \n\nCash dividends are corporate earnings that are paid out to stockholders. They \n\nare pay payouts of retained earnings, which is accumulated profit. Therefore, cash \n\ndividends reduce both the _Retained Earnings_ and _Cash_ account balances. \n\n_Cash Dividends_ is a contra stockholders’ equity account that temporarily \n\nsubstitutes for a debit to the _Retained Earnings_ account. At the end of the \n\naccounting period, _Cash Dividends_ is closed to _Retained Earnings_. \n\nThere are three prerequisites to paying a cash dividend: a decision by the Board \n\nof Directions, sufficient cash, and sufficient retained earnings. \n\nCash dividends are only paid on shares outstanding. No dividends are paid on \n\ntreasury stock, or the corporation would essentially be paying itself. \n\nThree dates are associated with a cash dividend. The **date of declaration** is the \n\ndate the corporation commits to paying the stockholders. On that date, a liability \n\nis incurred and the _Cash Dividends Paya",
    "ble_ is used to record the amount owed \n\nto the stockholders until the cash is actually paid. The **date of record** is the \n\ndate on which ownership is determined. Since shares of stock may be traded, \n\nthe corporation names a specific date, and whoever owns the shares on that date \n\nwill receive the dividend. There is no journal entry on the date of record. Finally, \n\nthe **date of payment** is the date the cash is actually paid out to stockholders. \n\n**1. Date of Declaration** \n\nDeclared a cash dividend of $32,000. **OR** \n\nDeclared a cash dividend of $2 per share on 10,000 shares of preferred stock \n\noutstanding (total $20,000) and $.50 per share on 24,000 shares of common \n\nstock outstanding (total $12,000). NOTE: The $20,000 for preferred and $12,000 \n\nfor common dividends can be combined into one journal entry. \n\n Account Debit Credit \n\n ▲ Cash Dividends 32,000 (10,000 x $2) + (24,000 x $.50) \n\n ▲ Cash Dividends Payable 32,000 \n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STOCKHOLDERS’ ",

If a cash dividend \n\nof $2 per share were de",
    "clared, the total cash dividends would be $42,000 (21,000 \n\nx $2). \n\n**6.6 STOCK DIVIDENDS** \n\nStock dividends are corporate earnings that are distributed to stockholders. \n\nThey are distributions of retained earnings, which is accumulated profit. With a \n\nstock dividend, stockholders receive additional shares of stock instead of cash. \n\nStock dividends transfer value from _Retained Earnings_ to the _Common Stock_ and \n\n_Paid-in Capital in Excess of Par – Common Stock_ accounts, which increases total \n\npaid-in capital. \n\n_Stock Dividends_ is a contra stockholders’ equity account that temporarily \n\nsubstitutes for a debit to the _Retained Earnings_ account. At the end of the \n\naccounting period, _Stock Dividends_ is closed to _Retained Earnings_. \n\nStock dividends are only declared on shares outstanding, not on treasury stock \n\nshares. \n\nThree dates are associated with a stock dividend. The **date of declaration** is \n\nthe date the corporation commits to distributing additional shares t",
    "o stockholders. \n\nOn that date, the stockholders’ equity account _Stock Dividends Distributable_ is \n\n\n PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY IN MORE DETAIL \n\n used to record the value of the shares due to the stockholders until the shares are distributed. The date of record is the date on which ownership is determined. Since shares of stock may be traded, the corporation names a specific date, and whoever owns the shares on that date will receive the dividend. There is no journal entry on the date of record. Finally, the date of distribution is the date the shares are actually distributed to stockholders. \n\n**1. Date of Declaration** \n\n Declared a 2% stock dividend on 21,000 shares of $10 par common stock outstanding. The fair market value is $15 per share. \n\n Account Debit Credit \n\n▲ Stock Dividends 6,300 21,000 x 2% x $15 (fair market value) \n\n▲ Stock Dividends Distributable 4,200 21,000 x 2% x $10^ (par value) \n\n▲ Paid-in Capital in Excess of Par Common Stock 2,10",

Stock Dividends Distributable is a stockholders’ equity account that substitutes for Common Stock until the stock can be issued. Stock Dividends Distributable can only be in multiples of par, just like Common Stock : the number of shares in the stock dividend times the par value per share. Paid-in Capital in Excess of Par Common Stock is used for any amount above par. \n\n**2. Date of Record - no journal entry** \n\n**3. Date of Distribution** \n\n Issued the stock certificates.

If a 2% stock \n\ndividend is declared, there would be 420 additional shares issued (21,000 x 2%). \n\n**6.7 STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY SECTION OF THE** \n\n**BALANCE SHEET** \n\nThe equation for the balance sheet is **Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders’** \n\n**Equity.** \n\nThe stockholders’ ",
    "equity section of the balance sheet reports the worth of \n\nthe stockholders. It has two subsections: Paid-in capital (from stockholder \n\ninvestments) and Retained earnings (profits generated by the corporation.) \n\n**Sample Stockholders’ Equity Section of the Balance Sheet** \n\n Paid in Capital Preferred Stock, $100, $100 par $1,000,000 (80,000 shares authorized, 10,000 shares issued) Excess of issue price over par preferred 10,000 Common stock, $25 par 500,000 (50,000 shares authorized, 20,000 shares issued) Excess of issue price over par common 150,000 From sale of treasury stock 2,000 Total paid in capital $1,662,000 Retained Earnings 130,000 Total 1,792,000 Deduct treasury stock 27,000 Total stockholders’ equity 1,765,000 \n\nTotal paid-in capital is the sum of the first five accounts above and equals \n\n_Preferred Stock_ plus _Paid-in Capital in Excess of Par Preferred_ plus _Common_ \n\n_Stock_ plus _Paid-in Capital in Excess of Par Common_ plus _Paid-in Capital from_ \n\n_Sale of Treasur",
    "y Stock._ \n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY IN MORE DETAIL \n\nCommon stock includes all shares issued, including those reacquired as treasury \n\nstock. Since treasury stock is not currently owned by stockholders, it should not be \n\nincluded as part of their worth. Therefore, the value of treasury stock shares is \n\nsubtracted out to arrive at total stockholders’ equity. \n\nIn summary, total stockholders’ equity equals total paid-in capital plus retained \n\nearnings minus treasury stock. \n\n_Cash Dividends_ and _Stock Dividends_ are not reported on the balance sheet. \n\n**6.8 STOCK SPLITS** \n\nA **stock split** is when a corporation reduces the par value of each share of \n\nstock outstanding and issues a proportionate number of additional shares. This \n\ndoes affect the number of shares outstanding and, therefore, the number of shares \n\ndividends will be paid on. It also may affect the par value and market price per \n\nshare, reducing them proportionately. However, the tot",
    "al dollar value of the shares \n\noutstanding does not change. No journal entry is required for a stock split. \n\n**EXAMPLE** \n\nA company has 10,000 shares outstanding. The par value is $16 per share. The \n\nfair market value per share is $20. The total capitalization (value of the shares \n\noutstanding) is $200,000 (10,000 x $20). \n\nThe company declares a 4-for-1 stock split. Multiply the number of shares by \n\n4: there are 40,000 shares outstanding after the split. Divide the par value by 4: \n\neach share has a par value of $4 after the split. Also divide the market value per \n\nshare by 4, resulting in $5 per share. The total capitalization (value of the shares \n\noutstanding) is still $200,000 (40,000 x $5). \n\n**6.9 CASH DIVIDENDS CALCULATIONS** \n\nPreferred stockholders are paid a designated dollar amount per share before \n\ncommon stockholders receive any cash dividends. However, it is possible that \n\nthe dividend declared is not enough to pay the entire amount per preferred share \n\nthat is",
    " guaranteed before common stockholders receive dividends. In that case \n\nthe amount declared is divided by the number of preferred shares. Common \n\nstockholders would then receive no dividend payment. \n\nPreferred stock may be cumulative or non-cumulative. This determines \n\nwhether preferred shares will receive dividends in arrears, which is payment for \n\ndividends missed in the past due to inadequate amount of dividends declared in \n\nprior periods. If preferred stock is non-cumulative, preferred shares never receive \n\npayments for past dividends that were missed. If preferred stock is cumulative, any \n\npast dividends that were missed are paid before any payments are applied to the \n\ncurrent period. \n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY IN MORE DETAIL \n\n**EXAMPLE** \n\n**25,000 shares of $3 non-cumulative preferred stock and 100,000** \n\n**shares of common stock.

Since \n\npreferred stockholders are entitled to receive the first $75,000 in each year, they \n\nreceive the entire amount of the dividend declared and the common shareholders \n\nreceive nothing. \n\nIn years 4 through 6, dividends of more than $75,000 were declared. In each of \n\nthose years, the preferred stockholders receive the first $75,000 and the common \n\nstockholders receive the remainder. \n\nThe preferred stockholders are never “caught up” for the amounts that were \n\nless than $75,000 that they missed out on in years 1 through 3. \n\n**EXAMPLE** \n\n**25,000 shares of $3 cumulative p",

The income statement shows the profitability of a business by presenting its revenue and expenses for a period of time and summarizes its profitability in one final result: net income. The retained earnings statement reports all of the profit that a business has accumulated since it began operations. The balance sheet is a comprehensive summary report that lists a business’s assets, liabilities, owner investments, and accumulated profit. Examples appear below. \n\n# 7 \n\n**Capstone Experiences:** \n\n**Statement of Cash Flows &** \n\n**Financial Statement Ana",
    "lysis** \n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING CAPSTONE EXPERIENCES \n\n**7.2 STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS** \n\nManagers, investors, and lenders are particularly interested in the availability \n\nof cash, where it comes from, and what it is used for in a business. However, the \n\nincome statement, retained earnings statement, and balance sheet do not directly \n\ntrack or report the flow of cash. Therefore, businesses prepare a fourth financial \n\nstatement, the statement of cash flows, to clearly provide information about the \n\nsources and uses of cash. \n\nThe statement of cash flows is based on information from the income statement, \n\nretained earnings statement, and balance sheet. Therefore, it is prepared last. \n\n**7.2.1 Types of Business Activities** \n\nAll business transactions can be classified as one of three types of activities: \n\noperating, investing, or financing. \n\n**Operating activities** are those involved in the day-to-day running of the \n\nbusiness. Accounts used for operating activitie",
    "s include all those on the income \n\nstatement as well as current assets and current liabilities on the balance sheet. \n\n(Current assets and liabilities are those that are expected to be converted to cash \n\nwithin one year.) Most of a business’ transactions are operating activities. \n\n**Investment activities** involve fixed or long-term assets that are found on \n\nthe balance sheet. These are assets that are expected to last more than one year. \n\nInvestment activities include buying and/or selling any of the following: equipment, \n\nvehicles, buildings, land, patents, investments in stock, and investments in bonds. \n\n**Financing activities** involve raising funds for a business and may include \n\nlong-term debt or equity accounts found on the balance sheet. These include \n\ntransactions involving the following: issuing common or preferred stock, issuing \n\nor redeeming bonds payable, and paying off a mortgage note payable. Buying \n\nor selling treasury stock and paying dividends are related t",
    "o stock and are also \n\nfinancing activities. \n\n**7.2.2 Cash Inflows and Outflows** \n\nThe statement of cash flows reports cash inflows and/or cash outflows in each \n\nof three sections: cash flows from operating activities, cash flows from investing \n\nactivities, and cash flows from financing activities. An inflow occurs when cash is \n\npaid to a business. An outflow is when a business makes a cash payment. \n\nEach of the three sections is summarized by one number, which is the net cash \n\nflows amount. If the summary number is positive, it means that more cash was \n\nreceived than was paid out for that activity during the accounting period. If the \n\nsummary number is negative, more cash was paid out than was received for that \n\nactivity during the period. \n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING CAPSTONE EXPERIENCES \n\nThe following sample journal entries are reminders of transactions that involve \n\ncash. The _Cash_ account is either debited or credited, to indicate a cash inflow or \n\ncash outf",
    "low, respectively. \n\n**EXAMPLE 1** \n\nWhen **_Cash_** is debited, there is a cash inflow. Here is an example of an investing \n\nactivity that results in a cash inflow: selling equipment. \n\n Account Debit Credit \n\n ▲ Cash 50,000 \n\n ▼ Accumulated Depreciation 1,000 ▼ Equipment 48,000 \n\n ▲ Gain on Sale of Equipment 3,000 \n\nCash inflow: $50,000. Notice there is a gain on this transaction. \n\n**EXAMPLE 2** \n\nWhen **_Cash_** is credited, there is a cash outflow. Here is an example of a \n\nfinancing activity that results in a cash outflow: calling bonds. \n\n Account Debit Credit ▼ Bonds Payable 100,000 \n\n ▲ Loss on Redemption of Bonds 5,000 \n\n ▼ Discount on Bonds Payable 3,000 ▼ Cash 102,000 \n\nCash outflow: $102,000. Notice there is a loss on this transaction. \n\n**EXAMPLE** \n\n You receive and cash your paycheck for the week for $400. This is a cash inflow. On the same day you pay your cell phone bill and car insurance payment for a total of $210. You then go out for dinner and pay $30 cash with ti",
    "p. These three payments are cash outflows. The net cash inflow on that day is $160; that is, $160 more came in than went out. \n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING CAPSTONE EXPERIENCES \n\n**EXAMPLE 3** \n\nWhen _Cash_ is debited, here is a cash inflow. Here is an example of a financing \n\nactivity that results in a cash inflow: issuing common stock. \n\n Account Debit Credit \n\n ▲ Cash 180,000 ▲ Common Stock 150,000 \n\n ▲ Paid-in Capital in Excess of Par Common Stock 30,000 \n\nCash inflow: $180,000. Notice there is no gain or loss on this transaction. \n\nThe operating activities section of the statement of cash flows appears first. It \n\nmay be prepared in one of two ways, using either the indirect or the direct method. \n\nThe **indirect method** begins with net income from the income statement and \n\nmathematically backs out non-cash transactions to arrive at cash flows from \n\noperating activities.The direct method itemizes all of the operating cash inflows, \n\nor receipts, followed by a list of th",
    "e operating cash ouflows, or payments. Although \n\ninformation presented in the operating activities section is different, both methods \n\nyield the same cash flows from operating activities amount. The indirect method \n\nis more popular because the information needed to prepare the section is readily \n\navailable on the income statement and balance sheet. The choice of methods \n\npertains only to the operating activities section. The investing and financing section \n\nboth are prepared using a direct method. \n\nThe following is a sample statement of cash flows that has been prepared based \n\non the financial statements presented on page 255. The operating activities \n\nsection uses the indirect method. \n\n\n PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING CAPSTONE EXPERIENCES \n\n Jonick Company Statement of Cash Flows For the Year Ended December 31, 2009 \n\nCash flows from operating activities: \n\n Net income $48,000 1. \n\nAdjustments to reconcile net income to net cash flow from operating activities: \n\n Depreci",

    "sections in the operating activities section. \n\n There is a caption that begins with “Cash flows from…” for each of the three sections. \n\n There is a final line that begins with “Net cash flow from…” for each of the three sections. \n\n There will be six amounts in the far right column. The first three are the net cash flows from each of the three activities. The sum of these three should equal the fourth amount, which is the increase or decrease in cash from one year to the next. \n\n The last three lines focus on cash. Cash at the beginning of the year and at the end of the year come from the comparative balance sheet; these amounts are given. The increase (or decrease) in cash is the difference between the two cash amounts. \n\n Jonick Company Statement of Cash Flows For the Year Ended December 31, 2009 \n\nCash flows from operating activities: \n\n Net income \n\nAdjustments to reconcile net income to net cash flow from operating activities: \n\nChanges in current operating assets and liabilitie",

Some of these involve cash; some do not. There are too many transactions to make it practical to look at each one individually to determine its impact on cash flow. Therefore, the income statement and comparative balance sheet numbers will be used to efficiently remove non-cash transactions in order to arrive at the net cash flow from operating activities number. The p",
    "rocess is described next. \n\n1. Enter the net income amount, which is the final number on the income     statement that is given. \n\nCash flows from operating activities: \n\n Net income $48,000 \n\n2. Adjust the net income amount to remove non-cash expenses such depreciation     expense and interest expense on the amortization of a bond discount. Also add     back losses and deduct gains shown on the income statement since they do     not pertain to operating activities and therefore do not belong in the operating     activities section. \n\nAdjustments to reconcile net income to net cash flow from operating activities: \n\n Depreciation 5,000 Gain on sale of investments (10,000) Loss on sale of equipment 1,000 \n\n3. Current assets and liabilities are used in the operation of the business and     are relatively short term; less than one year before used or converted to cash.     Identify the CURRENT assets (except Cash) and CURRENT liabilities on the     comparative balance sheet. Calculate the ",

Similarly, if a fixed asset’s balance decreases from one year to the next, it means that some or all of it was sold and there was a cash inflow. To help determine the amount of cash received or paid, refer to the journal entry for each transaction to see if Cash was debited or credited. \n\n IMPORTANT : It is possible for one fixed asset, such as equipment, to have both a sale and a purchase of two diff",
    "erent pieces of equipment for cash. This would have to be explained in a separate note in order to properly prepare the statement of cash flows. \n\n When a long-term or fixed asset is sold, there may be a gain or loss. This information would be found on the income statement. \n\n Jonick Company Income Statement For the Year Ended December 31, 2009 \n\n Other revenue and expenses Gain on sale of investments 10,000 Loss on sale of land (1,000) 9,000 Net income 48,000 \n\n\n PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING CAPSTONE EXPERIENCES \n\n The land cost $100,000 (given on the balance sheet) and there was a loss of $1,000 when it was sold (given on the income statement). That would mean there was a $99,000 cash inflow ($100,000 $1,000). The investments cost $80,000 (given on the balance sheet) and there was a gain of $10,000 when they were sold (given on the income statement). That would mean there was a $90,000 cash inflow ($80,000 + $10,000). The Equipment balance on the balance sheet at the beginning ",
    "of the year was $60,000 and at the end of the year was $221,000, an increase of $161,000. Since it was noted that no equipment was sold, this is the amount of the cash outflow for equipment. Each investing activity transaction is listed on its own line on the statement of cash flows. Cash inflows are listed first and each begins with “Cash received from…” Cash outflows follow and each begins with “Cash paid for…” If there is more than one inflow, they are subtotaled in the middle column. The same is true for more than one outflow. \n\n Cash flows from investing activities Cash received from sale of land $99,000 Cash received from sale of investment 90,000 $189,000 Cash paid to purchase equipment 161,000 Net cash flow from investing activities 28,000 \n\n Calculate net cash flows from investing activities amount by deducting cash outflows from cash inflows. This final summary amount indicates that $28,000 more “came in” than was paid out during this year for investing activities. (If it wer",
    "e a net cash outflow, use parenthesis to indicate this.) This is the second of six numbers in the right-hand column. As a different possibility, an asset account such as Equipment may have experienced more than one transaction rather than just a single purchase. Using the same comparative balance sheet information as in the previous example, note that the information to its right in item d. shows that some of the equipment was also sold. \n\n**Jonick Company** (^) NOTE: a. All investing and financing activities were for cash. b. No additional investments were purchased. c.

The calculation to determine the amount of the purchase is as follows: \n\n$221,000 ending balance ($60,000 beginning balance $10,000 cost of equipment sold given) = $171,000 purchased \n\n The same information about the equipment that was sold could have been provided in the form of a ledger account, such as the one that follows for Equipment : \n\n Equipment Date Item Debit Credit Debit Credit 1/1/2012 Balance 60,000 4/3/2012 10,000 50,000 9/12/2012 171,000 221,000 \n\n The beginning ",

The $10,000 credit entry is the cost of the equipment that was sold on April 3. The $171,000 debit entry in the debit column is the cost of the equipment that was purchased on September 12. The sale results in a cash inflow, and the purchase results in a cash outflow. \n\n**FINANCING ACTIVITIES SECTION** \n\n There are relatively few items in the financing activities section, so it is reasonable to look at them one by one to determine if there is a cash inflow or outflow and, if so, its amount. \n\n5. Identify the financing activities on the comparative balance sheet. These     are found in the long-term liabilities or stockholders’ equity sections of the     balance sheet. \n\n\n PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING CAPSTONE EXPERIENCES \n\n Jonick Company Comparative Balance Sheet December 31, 2019 and 2018 End 2019 End ",

Similarly, if a long-term liability account balance decreases from one year to the next, it means that it was repaid and there was a cash outflow. To help determine the amount of cash received or paid, refer to the journal entry for each transaction. \n\nCash flows from financing activities: \n\n Cash received from issuing common stock $20,000 Cash paid to redeem bonds $50,000 Cash paid for dividends 6,000 56,000 \n\nNet cash flow from financing activities (36,000) \n\n6.

In this case the calculation is $8,000 + $3,000 $5,000 = $6,000. \n\n Each financing activity transaction is listed on its own line on the statement of cash flows. Cash inflows are listed first and each begins with “Cash received from…” Cash outflows follow and each begins with “Cash paid for…” If there is more than one inflow, they are subtotaled in the middle column. The same is true for more than one outflow. \n\n\n PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING CAPSTONE EXPERIENCES \n\n8. Calculate net cash flows used for financing activities amount by deducting cash     outflows from cash inflows. Use parenthesis since it is a net cash outflow. This     final summary amount indicat",

Add the net cash flows amounts from the three types of activities. **The sum**     **should equal the increase (or decrease) in cash amount.** \n\n11. List the amounts of cash at the beginning and the end of the year that are given     on the balance sheet. The difference should equal the sum of the cash flows     amounts from the three types of activities. \n\nNet cash flow from operating activities $46,000 \n\nNet cash flow from investing activities 28,000 \n\nNet cash flow from financing activities (36,000) \n\nIncrease in cash $38,000 \n\nCash at the beginning of the year 12,000 \n\nCash at the end of the year $50,000 \n\n The statem",
    "ent of cash flows used in this example is a relatively simple one. There may be additional accounts that impact cash and therefore would also need to be included in other situations. Conversely, not all of the items on this sample statement of cash flows must be included on other statements. Only include those that are relevant to the problem or business you are working on and omit all others. \n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING CAPSTONE EXPERIENCES \n\n**FINAL FORMATTING NOTE FOR THE INVESTING AND** \n\n**FINANCING SECTIONS** \n\nIn the investing and financing sections, there may be cash receipts and/or \n\ncash payments. In each section, if there is more than one cash receipt, enter their \n\namounts in the left column and a subtotal in the middle column. If there is only \n\none receipt, enter it directly in the middle column. The same holds true for cash \n\npayments.

Cash dividends declared is additional amounts promised and owed to stockholders for the current year. Those two combined represent the total owed. The Cash Dividends Payable balance at the end of the year is what has not yet been ",
    "paid. The difference between the total owed and the total not yet paid is what must have been paid out in cash. Think of it this way. I borrowed $50 from a student last week. On the way to class today, I borrowed another $10 from him. I owe a total of $60 to this student. If we leave class today and I owe him $20, there is only one explanation: I must have paid him $40 while we were in class. That was my cash outflow during the period. \n\n\n PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING CAPSTONE EXPERIENCES \n\n The following is a sample statement of cash flows that has been prepared based on the financial statements presented on page 255.

The income statement shows \n\nthe profitability of a business by presenting its revenue and expenses for a period of \n\ntime and summarizes its profitability in one final result: net income. The retained \n\nearnings statement reports all of the profit that a business has accumulated since \n\nit began operations. The balance sheet is a comprehensive summary report that \n\nlists a busines",
    "s’s assets, liabilities, owner investments, and accumulated profit. \n\nExamples of basic financial statements appear below. \n\nOnce the financial statements are available, the next step is to analyze them \n\nto gleen useful information about a corporation’s performance over time and its \n\ncurrent financial health. These insights help business managers and investors \n\nmake decisions about future courses of action. Areas of weakness may be identified \n\nand followed up with appropriate measures for improvement. Elements of strength \n\nshould be reinforced and continued. \n\nMuch of this financial statement analysis is accomplished using ratios that \n\nreveal how one amount relates to another.

    "ime, both in terms of dollar amounts and percentage differences. \n\nComparative financial statements place two years (or more) of the same statement \n\nside by side. A **horizontal analysis** involves noting the increases and decreases \n\nboth in the amount and in the percentage of each line item. The earlier year is \n\ntypically used as the base year for calculating increases or decreases in amounts. \n\n**ANNUAL CHECK-UP** \n\n Many people visit a doctor annually for a check-up to evaluate their overall health. This often involves a physician looking, listening, poking, prodding, weighing, and conducting tests to assess the strength and wellness of multiple body parts and the status of vital signs and chemical levels. The results may be positive in some areas and less so in others. One deficiency or ailment may impact the body as a whole. As weaknesses are uncovered, measures such as medication, procedures, exercise, diet changes, etc. may be prescribed to assist with recovery. For example, ",
    "if high cholesterol levels and excessive weight are discovered, lifestyle changes and medication may be recommended. At the following year’s visit, subsequent testing will reveal the progress made over time in these areas as well as other diagnostic results on that particular date. The goal is to continuously address deficiencies for improvement and to maintain positive outcomes on an ongoing basis. A similar process is used for determining the operational and financial health of a corporation. The financial statements represent the current condition of an organization as a whole for a period of time. Probing, testing, and spot-checking efforts are conducted on a number of its parts to verify areas of strength and to pinpoint weaknesses. Action plans for improvement may then be prescribed to address substandard line items going forward. \n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING CAPSTONE EXPERIENCES \n\n Jonick Company Comparative Income Statement For the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 201",

Cash is the most liquid asset; other \n\ncurrent assets such as accounts receivable and inventory may also generate cash in \n\nthe near future. \n\nCreditors and investors often use liquidity ratios to gauge how well a business \n\nis performing. Since creditors are primarily concerned with a company’s ability to \n\nrepay its debts, they want to see if there is enough cash and equivalents available \n\nto meet the current portions of debt. \n\nSix liquidity ratios follow. The current and quick ratios evaluate a company’s \n\nability to pay its current liabilities. Accounts receivable turnover and number of \n\ndays’ sales in receivables look at the firm’s ability to collect its accounts receivable. \n\nInventory turnover and number of days’ sales in inventory gauge how effectively a \n\ncompany manages its inventory.",

The premise is that current assets are liquid",
    "; that is, they can be converted to cash in a relatively short period of time to cover short-term debt. A current ratio is judged as satisfactory on a relative basis. If the company prefers to have a lot of debt and not use its own money, it may consider 2.5 to be too high – too little debt for the amount of assets it has. If a company is conservative in terms of debt and wants to have as little as possible, 2.5 may be considered low – too little asset value for the amount of liabilities it has. For an average tolerance for debt, a current ratio of 2.5 may be considered satisfactory.

If a company is conservative in terms of debt and wants to have as little as possible, 2.0 may be considered low – too little asset value for the amount of liabilities it has.

Both investors and creditors are interested in the solvency of a company.

All the analytical measures discussed, taken individually and collectively, are used to evaluate a company’s operating performance and financial strength. They are particularly informative when compared over time to expected or desired standards. The ability to learn from the financial statements makes the processes of collecting, analyzing, summarizing, and reporting financial information all worthwhile. **7.4 SUMMARY** Most of this document has been a discussion of **financial** accounting, which relates to preparing the four financial statements the income statement, retained earnings statement, balance sheet, and state",
    "ment of cash flows – for a company as a whole. These reports are prepared according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to ensure consistency from company to company and period to period. The financial statements are published on a regular basis, such as monthly or annually, primarily for external users such a stockholders, creditors, investors, and government/tax entities. \n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING CAPSTONE EXPERIENCES \n\n**7.5 ACCOUNTING AS A PROFESSION** \n\nAt this point you have seen the process of accounting in terms of identifying, \n\nrecording, and summarizing financial transactions for a business. Much of what \n\nyou have learned so far involves the basics of financial accounting, which involves \n\nproducing reports to inform external groups – investors, boards of directors, \n\ncreditors, and government/tax agencies – about the company’s financial status. It \n\nis an excellent start, but the scope of the accounting profession is much more broad \n\nand diverse",
    " and is covered in other textbooks. \n\nA good stopping point for this text is to summarize the value of the material \n\nin this book and to look forward to what you might learn at more advanced levels. \n\nWe’ll do this by briefly discussing the different areas of practice that an accounting \n\nprofessional may become involved in. \n\nFirst, it is fair to say that any business person should have a background in \n\naccounting as part of their general business management skills. Accounting is \n\nthe language of business, and professionals will necessarily plan, make decisions, \n\nand evaluate the progress of their firms based on financial information. A sound \n\nunderstanding of accounting adds to a professional’s credentials and effectiveness. \n\nWhether you work for a company or own your own business, you will need to \n\nanalyze and act on information prepared through the accounting process. \n\nYou may also choose a career in accounting, where you have the opportunity \n\nto work in almost any industr",
    "y imaginable. An accountant is a professional who \n\nperforms accounting functions such as financial statement analysis and audits. \n\nAccountants may be employed by an accounting firm, work for a company with \n\nan internal accounting department, or set up an individual practice of their own. \n\nThere are five major fields of accounting. The kind of work these professionals do \n\nis determined by the field they choose: \n\n**Management accountants** provide company executives with the \n\ninformation and analyses they need to make decisions related to general company \n\noperations. Companies also use this information to prepare the financial reports \n\nthat are distributed to shareholders, creditors, regulatory agencies and the Internal \n\nRevenue Service (IRS). \n\n**Public Accountants** are part of the broadest accounting field. They \n\nprovide accounting, tax, auditing and/or consulting services to corporations, \n\nindividuals, governments, and nonprofits. Public accountants assist individuals \n\na",
    "nd corporations with a variety of financial tasks, including computing and filing \n\nincome taxes, reviewing financial records, staying up to date on fiscal regulations, \n\ncreating financial statements and providing general accounting advice. \n\nA certified public accountant, or **CPA** , is a person who has passed the difficult \n\nCPA Exam administered by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants \n\n(AICPA) and has been licensed by one of the states in the U.S. Most state boards \n\nof accountancy, including Georgia, require candidates to have 150 college credits \n\nin order to sit for the CPA Exam. The CPA’s license is then renewed if the state’s \n\n\n PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING CAPSTONE EXPERIENCES \n\n requirements continue to be met, including earning continuing professional education credits annually. Internal auditors review a company’s financial documents for accuracy and compliance with laws and regulations. They examine the internal controls of the organization and ",
    "attempt to discover and prevent inaccuracy, mismanagement and fraud. They identify potential risks and propose preventative measures for increased operational efficiency, risk management and regulatory compliance. Forensic accountants are examiners who analyze financial records to ensure they are compliant with standards and laws. Conversely, forensic accountants are brought in to uncover errors, omissions or outright fraud. They typically work in either investigation or litigation support. Government accountants/auditors are employed by federal, state and local governments. They do the books for government agencies and manage budgets, expenses and revenues at the federal, state, county and city levels for organizations such as the military, law enforcement and public schools. They also audit businesses and individuals who are required to conform to government regulations or pay tax. \n\n The following Accounts Summary Table includes all accounts covered in this document. \n\n ACCOUNTS SUM",

Thanks, guys! \n\nI wish to express my appreciation to Touro’s Dean of Faculties, Dr. Stanley Boylan who, over the years, has supported my academic work and with whom I can say that I have developed a warm personal and productive professional relationship. \n\nLast, I owe may greatest gratitude to my wife and three amazing children. When I joined Touro University’s Queens campus (the Lander College for Men), the school had just opened and had few students. The demands on my time were challenging. My then two children were under the age of three and needed paternal attention. I would come home late at night after having completed my classes and they would already be asleep. My now three children know little about my long life before I joined Touro; they know me only as a Touro professor. They forg",
    "ave me for not being there to do homework with them (I did manage to \n\nxx Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\nsqueeze in some) and for not tucking them in at night. They came out alright, thanks to the wonderful love and unceasing care of their mother, my dear wife, Mira. \n\nAnd it is to her that I owe the deepest and never-ending gratitude. Mira, you personify the notion of _Eshet Chayil_ , and are my personal Woman of Valor. To say more would merely be understatement and misspent words ( _haval al hazeman_ ). I love you forever and always. \n\nI am humbled and grateful to each and every one mentioned on these pages, and it is to you that these pages are dedicated. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis xxi \n\n\n## Open Touro Acknowledgements \n\nOpen Touro was founded by Touro College Libraries in 2018, as the Open Educational Resources initiative of Touro College & University System (now Touro University).

Each page is short and has a unique topical heading on which the student can focus and easily retain. The paragraphs are kept short, just as you will note they are on this page, to enable the reader to pause, take a breath, and review in his/her mind what s/he just read before going on. Occasionally, concepts and explanation are repeated in consecutive paragraphs in order to present an idea from multiple perspectives and to deepen one’s comprehension. \n\nThe writing style attempts to avoid jargon, except where necessary. In such cases, the terminology is explained",
    " so that the reader may proceed with clarity. Still, there are many words and phrases that one must acquire in Finance. At times, vocabulary words are highlighted in the margins. \n\nReaders are advised to simultaneously press on the “CTRL” and “F” buttons at which time a window will open in which a search word may be entered. This will enable the reader to go back and review concepts at will. \n\nThe chapters are organized and written so that the reader get directly to the point, without unnecessary information and “fluff.” There is a certain flow to the chapters and sections within the chapters that is intended to make learning smooth and enjoyable. \n\nxxiv Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n xxiv \n\n\nConcepts and Computations \n\nFinancial Analysis, by and large, incorporates Accounting concepts. Thus, it is imperative that the analyst understand the numbers, which s/he will utilize in his/her analysis. This text exposes the reader to the many shortcomings in reading Financial Statements. No prior knowledg",
    "e of Accounting is assumed. The text, in its early chapters, will tenderly lead the reader through the arcane world of Accounting and point out the many shortcomings in reading the statements and in conducting elementary Financial Analysis. The reader should have some facility with very basic Algebra, in particular, s/he should be able to solve for an unknown in a simple formula, to be able to transpose a value from one side of an equation to the other, and to be to calculate exponents and roots. The text will make Algebra easy by showing, where necessary, the correct solutions step-by-step. \n\nThe text will proceed to Ratio Analysis, the very basic tools of financial analysis, incorporating the previously learned Accounting data. It will then proceed to the notion of the Time Value of Money, which is the central concept in all of finance. The text will conclude with Stock and Bond Valuation, which are based on all the previous information of the text. Thus, the reader will build upon h",
    "is/her knowledge by going from concept to concept in smooth, linear fashion, ever reaching for higher and higher planes of knowledge. \n\n<span style=”text-decoration: underline;”The Nuances of Financial Analysis \n\nFinancial Analysis, at the end of the day, is just common sense, or common business sense. Financial and Mathe\n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis xxv \n\n\nmatical principles must conform to the realities of the field and not the other way around. The mathematics are a tool and not an end. In a sense, a financial analyst is bi-lingual; a student will translate financial principles into formulae when advised and can explain in plain English the meaning and application of such formulae when first presented with one. It is all supposed to make sense. This book tries to capture this dual and essential nature of Finance. As the reader goes through the text, s/he should increasingly gain a sense of empowerment, confidence, and mastery of the subject. \n\nQuotations \n\nThe text is replet",
    "e with quotations from an eclectic myriad of sources including the Bible, the Talmud, great Greek philosophers, famous politicians, modern and popular thinkers from the 18th century onward, and more. The quotations are not intended to postulate or promote a point-ofview, especially where religion is concerned, but instead to inspire the reader to persevere in his/her study, to continue toward the achievement of great heights, and to always consider the social impact of his/her actions. Mastery of Finance presents a person with the opportunity to better oneself in so many ways while simultaneously bettering society-at-large. And that is very cool. \n\nProblem-solving \n\nIn virtually each chapter and ends-of chapters, the reader will find formulae to be solved, tables that need to be filledin, and occasional diagrams to be drawn. The intent is to make the material come alive so that the student can both learn and test him/herself in the process. Solutions are generally provided to all these",

    "inance function     within the corporation. \n\n- **Distinguish** between abstract and concrete rea-     soning. \n\n- **Formulate** abstract hypotheses and statements. \n\n- **Think** deliberatively as a financial professional. \n\n3 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 3 \n\n\n## 1.2 The Corporation \n\n There are two ways of being happy: We must either diminish our wants or augment our means – either may do –the result is the same and it is for each man to decide for himself and to do that which happens to be easier. -Benjamin Franklin \n\nWhat is a corporation? You may have noticed that the Latin word “corpus” seems to appear within it. Indeed, it is a body! It is not human or animal, and it has no physical shape. You cannot see it or touch it. It will have components that take physical form, such as a building or inventory, but the corporation itself is non-corporeal. \n\nSo, what is it? It is a legal entity. It exists only as a legal construct. As such it is said that the corporation is a “person” under the law. ",
    "It exists in a legal sense. It can be sued. It can be fined. It is owned by people who purchase ownership interests in it. These interests or “claims” are called “shares” or “stock.” Owners are referred to as “shareholders.” Shareholders have a claim on the company’s profits. We may thus also refer to this type of corporation as a “stock corporation.” It is in business – generally speaking – \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 4 \n\n 4 \n\n\nto make money for its shareholders, although it may serve other more altruistic purposes as well. \n\nThe corporation, thus, as an independent person, is legally separate from the owners. The corporation may be sued for damages, but the owners may not be – unless the court determines that the owner is somehow legally liable for a wrong-doing himself and apart from the separate actions of the corporation. Therefore, the owners are protected from legal responsibilities. This does not absolve corporate managers from legal malfeasance if they did other wron",
    "gs, e.g., dumping waste illegally. \n\nOne downside to the owners is that the corporation itself is a taxable entity. It pays income taxes and then the shareholders, once again, will pay income taxes on any profits distributed to them. These profit distributions are called “dividends.” We class this “double taxation.” \n\nOf course, there are numerous other means by which a company may be organized in order to avoid double-taxation, but not all will provide the umbrella protection that the corporation provides. You can learn about these business forms in a Management or Tax course. \n\n5 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n## 1.3 Business / Corporate Structure: The \n\n## Management Organization \n\nIt is well and fine, and critical, to learn what the Finance discipline’s intellectual landmarks are, but the student certainly wants to know how Finance fits into the actual corporate (business) context, which is the focus of this text. Here we shall see. \n\nThe corporation will have both an “organizational structur",
    "e,” detailing the manner in which the firm actually operates and a capital structure, which is depicted on the Balance Sheet. We will get to the Balance Sheet soon. First, the organization. \n\nThere are four-six basic business functions in the organization: \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 6 \n\n 6 \n\n\n## 1.4 The Finance Function Within the \n\n## Corporation \n\nThe controller and treasurer of a company serve different functions, although these differences may vary from firm to firm. Both report to the vice president of finance or chief financial officer (CFO). One of the two may also be the CFO, more probably the treasurer. There will be some variance in structure from company to company. The CFO reports to the Chief Operating Officer (COO) or to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). \n\nHere are some _typical_ functions of each. \n\n7 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 7 \n\n\nIntroduction to Financial Analysis 8 \n\n\n## 1.5 Capital Structure \n\nAbove, we discussed the firm’s organizational structure. This is how",
    " corporations operate. The firm will also have a “Capital Structure,” which will be represented on its Balance Sheet. The Balance Sheet will consist of Assets, Liabilities and Owners’ Equity. \n\nAssets are what the company owns, including inventory, plant and equipment, among other items. Liabilities are what the company owes to others including suppliers and lenders. Equity is the value of what the owners have invested in the company. \n\nCompanies acquire _Capital_ (Liabilities + Equity) in order to, in turn, “finance” (i.e., pay for) the acquisition and maintenance of its assets. Assets, in turn, are exploited to produce sales, which will – hopefully – deliver profits and a return to the shareholders, who are the owners of the corporation. \n\nThe basic “accounting equation” is: Assets equals Liabilities plus Equity, or A = L + E. A Balance Sheet must, well, balance, as noted here. \n\nAssets will be on the left and Liabilities plus equity will be on the right – like the Ten Commandments! ",
    "In general, \n\n9 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 9 \n\n\nthe word “Capital” will refer to the right side of the Balance Sheet. The firm’s Capital is not free; it has an economic cost; lenders expect interest on its loans to the company and shareholders expect dividends and the growth of dividends of their equity investment in the firm. The economic cost of the firm’s capital represents the return to lenders and stock investors. Where there is a return to investors (lenders and owners), there must be a cost to the corporation who provides the return. Two sides to the same coin. \n\nIn order to be competitive, a corporation must also cover its “Opportunity Cost.” If an investor in the corporation can earn a better return in an equivalent alternative investment, s/he will choose the better alternative. This is a basic principle of Economics. The corporation, in order to be able to attract investment, must therefore cover its Opportunity Costs, i.e., the alternative return an investor gives up when making a",
    "n investment in this corporation. \n\nWe will discuss the Balance Sheet further in depth on the pages to follow. For now, let’s re-wire our brains so that we think like Financial Economists. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 10 \n\n\n Key Terms: \n\n Abstract Abstraction Simplification \n\n## 1.6 Thinking Like an \n\n## Economist: Abstraction \n\nEconomics, and its offspring, Finance, are **abstract** (social) sciences. In order to study economics, it is essential that one understands what an **abstraction** is. \n\n An abstraction is an idea, intended to mirror reality in its simplest form. The world is a very complicated place; there are many variables or inputs, some identifiable, others not, that affect an outcome, and which we endeavor to identify. In order to understand the outcome which is generally true, but not necessarily absolutely or always so, one must engage in a process of simplification that requires removing minor variables from a general idea in order to reduce the notion to its",
    " essential characteristics. Indeed, the Latin word, “abstract,” comes from “drawing” or “taking away from.” \n\n The ever-changing kaleidoscope of raw reality \n\n11 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 11 \n\n\n First Principles Ceteris Paribus All else equal \n\n Default Assumption Premise \n\n would defeat the human mind by its complexity, except for the mind’s ability to abstract, to pick out parts and think of them as a whole. Thomas Sowell A Conflict of Visions (2002), p. 5 \n\nIn this process, one is able to derive a broad, general conclusion, based on **first principles** from which is derived a general idea or rule. In economics, this requires a **_ceteris paribus_** assumption, that is to say, holding “ **all else equal** .” Initially, it is assumed that no other variables matter and are thus ignored away. It takes some discipline to do this at first, but it quickly becomes easy; you must merely keep it in mind. \n\nIn circumstances where little given or known information may be at hand, one must assume rea",
    "sonable **default assumptions** , i.e., **premises** , which make sense in general and in the simplest, most common form possible. While it may be facile to \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 12 \n\n\n Dialectical Reasoning Mode of Reasoning Thesis/ Antithesis/ Synthesis \n\n imagine other considerations, or variables, that may come into play, one must avoid doing this, in order to focus on just a few key variables, which affect the outcome. Here is a relevant comment by Dr. Milton Friedman 1 : \n\n A hypothesis is important if it “explains” much by little, that is, if it abstracts the common and crucial elements from the mass of complex and detailed circumstances surrounding the phenomena to be explained and permits valid predictions on the basis ofthem alone. To be important, therefore, a hypothesis must be descriptively false in its assumptions; it takes account of, and accounts for, none of the many other attendant circumstances, since its very success shows them to be irrelevant for t",
    "he phenomena to be explained…. \n\n To be sure, Dr. Friedman’s comments are not without criticism, but nevertheless are adhered to, by and large, in the social sciences, including, of course, economics. In certain other disciplines, including law, political theory, history, philosophy, and possibly others, we do not engage in this mode of reasoning. In these fields, by contrast, we are often engaged in dialectical reasoning. There, we first state a thesis , then examine its antithesis. We go back and forth numerous times until we can arrive at a synthesis , which is conclusive or dispositive. \n\n1. Friedman, Milton. (1953). Essays in Positive Economics. Chicago: University     of Chicago Press. pp. 14-15. \n\n 13 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n Descriptive Contextual Concrete Generalizable \n\nThose of you that are accustomed to dialectical reasoning must diligently avoid the natural instinct to quickly imagine the antithesis; rather you must remain steadfast to the line of reasoning demanded by the mor",
    "e linear manner of abstract argumentation, based on first principles and ceteris paribus delimitations. (A “delimitation” is a limitation that one person herself imposes on the scope of her reasoning.) \n\nWhen, in certain instances, we deviate from abstract reasoning, we assume specific, more **descriptive** , circumstances in a **contextual** or **“concrete”** manner. The result may not be **generalizable**. If a conclusion is generalizable, we say that it is true in the overwhelming number of instances, although not necessarily all. \n\nFor instance, it is known via mathematics and reason, that interest rates and stock prices are inversely related. Rates go up, prices go down. This is true beyond any doubt – if we assume ceteris paribus. At the same time, it is more than just interest rates alone that affect stock prices. \n\nOne of the beauties of abstract reasoning is that it enables us to employ other, more reasonable assumptions when we find that a model has poor predictive power. \n\nH",

Bigel \n\n\n## 1.7 Abstraction: Absurd AND \n\n## Necessary \n\nYou thought we were done talking about abstraction. Sorry \n\n- one last discussion. It is that important. Here’s a relevant joke: \n\nA chemist, a physicist, and an economist are stranded on a desert island. They have an ample supply of canned food, but alas, no can opener. \n\nThe chemist suggests that they should light a fire under the cans so that they would burst open. The physicist suggests dropping the cans from the cliff to its rocky bottom to smash them open. \n\nThe economist declares: “Let’s assume we have a can opener.” \n\nFinancial and economic theory makes, what may appear at first, some absurd assumptions. But that is only because the social world, the world inhabited by people, is far more complex, in many ways, than the real world, the world of the hard science",
    "s. \n\nAre the chemist’s molecules motivated by fear and greed? Will ambition or altruism affect the trajectory of the falling cans? Economists cannot keep track of every alternative that the human mind may consider, so it abstracts by looking into the outcomes or choices that are usually indepen\n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 16 \n\n 16 \n\n\ndent of human foibles, or dare I say, are “logical.” Without abstraction, economists would never arrive at any generalizations. We would therefore learn nothing! Zilch. \n\nSuppose you just arrived in New York City for the first time. If you wish to find Times Square, would you use a map (imagine that there is no GPS or Waze) that details all the streets, or just the main arteries? No! You would not be concerned with all the confusing, and mostly useless, details. \n\nA burgeoning field, Behavioral Economics and Finance, deals with the human condition and its interaction with traditional, “objective” economics. However, first things first. \n\n Being ig",
    "norant is not so much a shame, as being unwilling to learn. -Benjamin Franklin \n\n Instruct me and I shall be silent. Make me understand where I have erred. \n\n -Book of Job (6:24) (Artscroll translation) \n\n17 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n## 1.8 Modes of Reasoning: Dialectical \n\n## versus Analytic \n\nWhat is Dialectical Reasoning? \n\n1. The process of arriving at the truth by stating a     thesis, developing a contradictory antithesis     based on concrete possibilities, and combining     them into a coherent synthesis, often after     numerous variations and iterations. \n\n2. A method of “argument” or exposition that sys-     tematically weighs an idea with a view to the reso-     lution of its real or apparent contradictions. \n\nHow to Engage in Abstract or Analytic Reasoning \n\nAnalytic argumentation differs markedly from Dialectical. The following pertains to the Analytic method only. Keep it in mind. \n\n1. Analytic reasoning commences with a first prin-     ciple or assumption. On this foundation,",
    " an     “argument” is built. \n\n ◦ Assumptions must be reasonable and generally true. \n\n2. An argument is not a debate. Do not start with     an oppositional counter-statement. It is not     about “winning.” \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 18 \n\n 18 \n\n\n3. Do not spar with the argument. First try to     understand it. \n\n ◦ Taking a contrary position will not assist you in understanding the proposition or argument better. \n\n4. Arguments are often nuanced, not black and     white. \n\n5. An argument is not an opinion. The latter is sub-     jective. \n\n6. In college (and later in life), an opinion is not     necessarily a “right” to which a student is “enti-     tled.” Sound reasoning, i.e., a good argument,     trumps opinion. \n\n7. Any position you take must be based on sound     argument. \n\n The Talmudic method invariably prefers to pose questions in a concrete rather than an abstract form. \n\n- Rabbi Adin Even-Israel Steinsaltz _Reference Guide to the Talmud_ , p. 131 (2014) \n\nWe can s",
    "afely assert that if one applies a lit match to a piece pf paper, the paper will burn. This is true in general and assumes that all else is equal. BUT what IF it is raining? What IF the paper is treated with a fire retardant? Do these, \n\n19 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\nsomewhat absurd violations of our ceteris paribus postulate negate the veracity of the general principle that paper burns? Here the word “BUT” is oppositional. The word “IF” creates a concrete context, a narrow circumstance, with the, often unconscious, purpose of finding reason to deny a generally sound principle, e.g., that paper burns. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 20 \n\n\n## 1.9 Finance Style \n\nStudents very often will come to their first finance class well-read in an impressive host of subjects, including history, literature, and more, but not necessarily in economics or finance. \n\nFinance, as certain other “scientific” subjects, is written in a markedly different style; it is notably terse and succinct. Words are not ",
    "parsed, and expansive, colorful prose is consistently eschewed. Sparse, precise language is the rule. \n\nUnlike literature, for instance, one may find that s/he has to read the same sentence several times until s/he gets it. You just can’t put your feet up, and slice through many pages in relatively short order. \n\nDo not get frustrated when this happens. Kick around the notions discussed in your head, until you get it. Then kick it over again; you may find that you can see the same thing from different angles with increasing thought. That should invigorate you. Start thinking in Abstract Terms – like a Financial Economist. \n\nSpend extra time on each paragraph and page. You may find that you have to substantially slow down the pace of your reading. \n\nAs formulae are presented, carefully check the calculations to be sure you agree. You will find this extremely helpful \n\n21 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 21 \n\n\nin increasing your understanding and insight. Always keep your calculator handy as you read",
    ". \n\nBe methodical and take your time. You will find that you will adjust to the new style, and you will find enjoyment in your increasing mastery! Think deliberately. Don’t think too fast! \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 22 \n\n\n# Chapter 2: Financial \n\n# Statements Analysis: The \n\n# Balance Sheet \n\n23 Kenneth S.

Finance begins where the Certified Public Accountant’s job ends. The accountant’s job is to carefully examine ",
    "the company’s financial records (its “books”) in order first to determine their accuracy and veracity. The accountant will then simplify the data and summarize them into three Financial Statements: The Balance Sheet, The Income Statement, and the Cash Flow Statement. In this text we will deal only with the first two statements. \n\nThe accountant does not have completely free rein regarding the manner in which the financial data are summarized. S/he must abide by “Generally Accepted Accounting Principles”, also known simply as GAAP. This is the rulebook for the accounting profession. GAAP rules are set by the accounting profession’s rule-making body, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). The accounting profession in turn, derives its legal status from a federal government organization called the Security and Exchange Commission or “SEC.” By law, the SEC empowers the accounting profession to make its own rules and to police the rules – with the SEC’s oversight. As many of you m",
    "ay already know, the SEC also oversees the United States’ financial markets. \n\nAll Financial Statements, including the Balance Sheet, will be provided to lenders who will examine the statements \n\n25 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 25 \n\n\nprior to making any lending determinations. “Public Companies,” i.e., corporations whose stock is “traded” (bought and sold) on a public stock exchange where stock is bought and sold, are required to release their statements to anyone who requests them. Again, this is an SEC requirement. \n\nThe skilled financial analyst will then read the statements because s/he is an “interested party” and wants to know whether an investment in the company is well and fine or whether a potential investment may be advised. S/he may represent lenders or equity shareholders; either party may be considered “investors.” Reading the statements requires advanced education concerning how the accountant compiled the statements. GAAP rules are quite complex. \n\nIn summary, the accountant is a",
    " trained historian of sorts. The financial analyst will read the accountant’s end-product but is more future oriented. The latter is only concerned about how a potential investment will perform in the future. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 26 \n\n\n## 2.3 The Balance Sheet \n\nThe Balance Sheet presents a static, unchanging, still-photograph of a company’s financial position at a moment in time, i.e., “as of” a certain date, often December 31st. In theory, any of the figures on the balance sheet would be different, either larger or smaller, on the very first day following (or before) the statement date. The Balance Sheet is usually issued every quarter, i.e., every three months. A very simple balance sheet will look something like the following (with the numbers filled in). Take note that any actual Balance Sheet you may examine may differ from this simple example. \n\n XYZ Corp. Balance Sheet as of 12.31.XX \n\nAll Asset accounts are “debit balance” accounts. That means that when the ac",
    "count increases (decreases), the amount is recorded on the debit (credit) side of the firm’s ledger. Liability and Equity Accounts are “credit balance” accounts. We make these entries into the bookkeeper’s ledger’s “T-Accounts” (see immediately below). This \n\n27 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 27 \n\n\nmechanistic framework is fundamental to “double-entry book-keeping.” \n\nLet’s repeat this: Asset accounts are “debit balance” (debit = “Dr”) accounts, whereas liability and owners’ (or shareholders’) equity are “credit balance” (credit = “Cr”) accounts. Increases (decreases) in asset accounts are characterized by debit (credit) entries; increases (decreases) in liability and equity accounts are characterized by credit (debit) entries. \n\nIn “double-entry” bookkeeping, for every debit entry there must be a credit entry. Debits must equal credits, and the balance sheet must balance: Total Assets = Total Liabilities + Equity. This is the basic accounting equation. \n\nBasic accounting equation: The following ",
    "equations must, by definition, be true: \n\n A = L + E (Assets = Liabilities plus Equity) \n\n A – L = E (Assets minus Liabilities = Equity) \n\nThere are also contra-asset accounts (such as accumulated depreciation and allowance for uncollectible accounts receivables), which are “credit balance” (credit = Cr) accounts. These contra-accounts effectively reduce the (net) asset accounts and are credit entries. \n\nThe phrase “current,” as in “current assets,” has to do with the life of the asset – or liability. According to the accoun\n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 28 \n\n\ntant, any asset (or liability), which is consumed (or paid) within an accounting period (i.e., one year), is current. Any asset – or liability – that has a life exceeding one year is “long-term.” Thus, inventory is placed “above the line,” under current assets. So too is the case with accounts payable. Property is long-term, for example. More on this next…. \n\n29 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n## 2.4 Sample Bookkeeping Entries \n\nHere ",
    "are some examples of simple bookkeeping (or “journal” or “ledger”) entries, exemplifying double-entry bookkeeping standards. Keep in mind that assets are debit balance accounts, while liabilities and equity are credit balance accounts. Debits must always equal credits. (All the numbers below are in thousands of dollars.) \n\n1. Let’s say that a company buys inventory for     $1,000 in cash. What are the correct bookkeep-     ing entries? \n\n You will note that cash goes down (credit) and inventory goes up (debit). You will note that the basic accounting equation (A = L + E) remains unchanged. \n\n2. What happens when a company borrows money     by issuing long-term debt for $5,000? \n\n First, debt increases (credit) and so too will cash (debit). You will note that both sides of the the basic accounting equation increase. \n\n3. What if the company borrows $7,500 in order to \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 30 \n\n 30 \n\n\n buy back some of its stock? \n\n Debt increases (credit) and equity goes",
    " down (debit). The purchased equity becomes what is called “Treasury Stock,” which is a contraaccount and thus a debit balance account. The equity may be reissued again in the future, should the company choose to do so. Another example of a contra-account would be “Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Receivables,” which would be a credit balance account versus accounts receivables. \n\n4. What happens when the company buys $500 in     inventory on credit terms? \n\n Inventory rises (debit) and payables also increase (credit). \n\n31 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n## 2.5 Current Assets: Inventory and \n\n## Accounts Receivable \n\nThe accountant defines the word, “current,” as in “current asset” – or “current liability” – as an item, which is consumed or exhausted within one calendar year. On the balance sheet, we observe numerous such assets and liabilities. For example, inventory is held by the corporation for sale in the near future and, presumably, is sold in less than one year (in most instances). In fact,",
    " the sooner the corporation disposes of its inventory the better, by and large. \n\n“Accounts receivable” is a current asset that bears some further explanation. In many instances, a customer pays for goods purchased at the point of sale. He receives the goods (i.e., the corporation’s inventory) and pays at the same time.That is what usually happens when consumers buy goods at the store. At the time of (a “cash”) sale, the seller reduces inventory (credit) and increases cash (debit). \n\nIn many, if not most, large business transactions, the customer may receive the goods, but not pay for them until later. The seller may grant the customer “credit” for the purchase and require “terms of sale” to which the buyer agrees. The terms of sale will dictate that the customer pay for the goods, typically, but not always, within thirty days of delivery. This sale would be referred to as a “credit sale” rather than a “cash sale,” and would be indicated as such on the company’s income statement (see b",
    "elow). \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 32 \n\n 32 \n\n\nAt the time of the credit sale, the seller will record, or “book,” an account receivable for the sale on its balance sheet, while the buyer will book an account payable on its. Simultaneously, the seller reduces (i.e., credits) his inventory and the buyer increases (i.e., debits) his. \n\nWhen payment is made, the accounts receivable are adjusted (as will the cash account). In the case of the seller, the account receivable is reduced (i.e., credited) and the cash account will be increased (i.e., debited). \n\nIn the case of the buyer, the account payable will be reduced (i.e., debited) and cash will be reduced (i.e., credited) as well. \n\n33 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n## 2.6 Financial Claims Hierarchy \n\nLenders and owners have different claims on the company’s interests. There is a distinct hierarchy in which the corporation’s claimants get paid – in order from first to last: \n\nDebtholders (Lenders): They get paid first. This includes the in",
    "terest on loans, and on the loan’s principal when due. Loan payments are made as contracted, and do not increase should the firm become more profitable. Dividends may not be paid to shareholders unless loan payments have been made first, and in full. \n\nPreferred shareholders: These owners (usually) get paid a fixed payment or “dividend,” which cannot increase even if the firm’s profits increase. If the firm is unable to pay the dividend it may skip it. However, most preferred dividends are “cumulative,” which means that no common stock dividends may be paid unless and until all past unpaid dividends that have accumulated “in arrears” are paid in full first. \n\nCommon shareholders: These shareholders get their dividends last, and are effective owners of any earnings, which the firm does not pay out, but “retains” and reinvests back into the firm in the manner of added property, plant, equipment, and working capital. In other words, common shareholders have a claim on the firm’s net incom",
    "e (after preferred dividends have been paid). \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 34 \n\n 34 \n\n\nCommon shareholders take on the most risk as they are last ones “on the totem pole.” Such is the case whether the firm is an ongoing enterprise or is being liquidated in bankruptcy. They get paid last. Common shareholders have a “residual” claim, or interest, in the company – after all other interests are taken care of. \n\nOn the other hand, the common shareholders have the most to gain if the firm is profitable; the dividend may be increased and more earnings may be retained – to their financial benefit, as the firm’s “retained earnings” are owned by the common shareholders. \n\nAgain, only common shareholders benefit if profits go up; common share ownership entails more risk, since if interest and preferred dividends are not paid, there may be nothing left for the common shareholders. \n\nGovernment and Taxes: Let’s not forget that, after interest has been paid, the earnings of the company are ",
    "then taxed, and that dividends are paid out of Net Income – after taxes have been paid. Taxes are a given, and normally, we do not think of the government as a claimant on the firm, since it is neither lender nor owner. \n\n Nothing is certain except death and taxes. \n\n -Benjamin Franklin \n\n35 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\nIntroduction to Financial Analysis 36 \n\n\n## 2.7 Interest Paid on Bonds and \n\n## Dividends Paid on Stock \n\n- Interest on debt is tax deductible to the corpora-     tion; dividends on preferred and com-     mon stocks are not tax-deductible, under current     law.        ◦ Interest must be paid before any divi-           dend payments on preferred and com-           mon stocks may be made. \n\n- Preferred stock dividends are usually fixed (like     the interest on most bonds). Even if the corpora-     tion becomes more profitable, the preferred     stock dividend cannot be increased. There is no     upside, in this case.        ◦ Only after interest is paid on the cor-           por",
    "ation’s debt, may preferred divi-           dends then be paid. If the dividend is           not paid, it is not considered a           “default” as with a loan or debt; this is           because preferred stock represents           ownership interests and not a liability.           Preferred stock is thus thought of as a           hybrid debt/equity security as it has           characteristics of both.        ◦ Most preferred shares are “cumula-           tive,” which means that before any           dividends are paid to common share- \n\n37 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 37 \n\n\n holders, all those preferred dividends that have not been paid, and are thus said to have accumulated unpaid or “in arrears,”must first be paid^2. \n\n- Common stock is most risky– first, because its     dividends are the last to be paid and sec-     ondly, because common shareholders are the last     to be paid off in bankruptcy (thus the phrase     “residual interest,” used above).        ◦ However, as common shareholders ",
    "          have rights to “residual” profits (i.e.,           after interest is paid on debt and, sec-           ond, after preferred stock dividend           distributions) that the firm may gener-           ate, common shareholders           also have the most opportunity to           share in positive earnings growth, i.e.,           they have the most to gain.        ◦ As a result, common shares usually           come with “voting rights,” i.e., the           ability annually to vote for company           management and on certain key           issues. Notably preferred shares rarely           carry such rights. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 38 \n\n\n## 2.8 Bankruptcy \n\nMany students think that bankruptcy is a death knell. It is not – necessarily. It can actually be a good thing, which ensures the survival of an enterprise that experienced financial stress. There are different forms of bankruptcy. The forms are categorized by “chapters,” under Title 11 of the United States Bank",
    "ruptcy Code. Let’s briefly see what the principal bankruptcy forms are, as noted in the Code by chapter, and how each form is different. \n\nChapter 7: \n\nThis bankruptcy form allows debtors to eliminate most or all of their debts over a short period of time, often just a few months. Only student loans, child support payments and some other debts may survive. Here, a trustee is appointed who then liquidates unsecured debts and makes the proper distributions. Collateral on secured debt may be repossessed. Certain assets will be protected, such as social security insurance. To qualify for Chapter 7, the debtor must satisfy a “means test.” If the test is not satisfied, the debtor may seek relief under Chapter 13. \n\nChapter 11: \n\nHere, the debtor retains ownership and control of assets. The debtor is referred to as a “debtor in possession.” The “DIP” runs the day-to-day affairs of the business while the creditors work with the bankruptcy court to work out a plan to be made whole. If the credi",
    "tors come to an agreement, \n\n39 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 39 \n\n\nthe business continues operating and certain agreed-upon payments are made. If there is no agreement, the court intercedes; debtors filing a second time are referred to as Chapter 22 filers. \n\nChapter 13: \n\nIn this form, debtors retain ownership and possession of the assets (in contrast to Chapter 7), and will make payments to a trustee from future earnings, which will then be disbursed to creditors. There is a five-year limit in which this process must be completed. Secured creditors may receive larger payments. \n\n Students’ take-away: Bankruptcy is not always the end of the story. \n\n Advice: One should consult with an attorney to obtain detailed, actionable information regarding these complex laws. \n\n Question: In the Banking Crisis of 2008, the United States government rescued, or bailed out, General Motors; it purchased stock in the company, using taxpayer funds. Was that the right move? Would it have been better for Uncle S",
    "am to have allowed the corporation to fail and file under the Bankruptcy Code? \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 40 \n\n\n## 2.9 The Balance Sheet, Net Income, and \n\n## the Common Shareholder \n\nNet income is an Income Statement number, which is also very relevant to the balance sheet. \n\nWhat happens to net income – or profits – after it is recorded? Let’s say the company records net income of $1 million for the year. If the company pays dividends to its shareholders of, say $100,000, those funds are now theirs and not the corporation’s. The shareholders are enriched to the extent of $100,000 (less taxes). \n\nThis leaves $900,000 in “addition to retained earnings,” which at the year’s end will be transferred by the accountant from the income statement to the retained earnings account in the equity section of the balance sheet. (This is done when the accountant “closes out the books” at year’s end, at which time the income statement reverts to zero.) Of course, as owners of the corporati",
    "on, all retained earnings, in fact, belong to the common shareholders as well. Thus, from the point of view of the balance sheet, the common shareholders own both the “common stock” and the “retained earnings.” The preferred shareholders just own the preferred stock. \n\n41 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 41 \n\n\n## 2.10 Corporate Goals \n\nIt is well known that in a Capitalist economy, the corporation is said to serve the interests of the owners. (While there may be additional purposes, we shall assume this simple premise.) The owners wish to earn profits, to “make money.” In theory, we shall assume that the owners and, by extension, the corporation has a neverending appetite for profits and corporate growth. We shall say that the corporation has no interest in vacation, rest, or “doing good,” the lack of which premises may, in fact, be false. \n\n“Growth,” thus, refers to the increase in a corporation’s sales or revenues, which in turn provide increasing levels of profits to the benefit of the corporati",
    "on’s owners. This brings us to the Balance Sheet. No company can produce sales without assets. It is assets (the left side of the Balance Sheet) that produce goods and services for sale. However, assets must be paid for, or more accurately, “financed” when cash itself is unavailable. \n\nThe financing of the company’s assets comes from raising capital in the form of liabilities, including borrowed money, and injections of cash from owners who purchase shares of equity in the corporation when such shares are offered by the corporation. (This is distinctly different from secondary market trading where shares are bought from selling shareholders with no corporate involvement.) Financing sources also include profits which the company retains – “Retained Earnings.” \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 42 \n\n 42 \n\n\nAs the company increases its capital, it is then equipped to acquire more assets with which to increase its sales and profits ad infinitum. Thus, as the balance sheet itself increas",
    "es, so too does the potential for corporate growth as we define it. Round and round she goes. \n\n43 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n## 2.11 Words and Numbers (An Aside) \n\nIn business and perhaps in Finance in particular, memorization is less important than active, creative thinking. Some people find math intimidating, but it does not have to be. By and large, Finance does not require the memorization of formulas. However, one must _understand_ the mathematics. \n\nThis is an important distinction. If you regard formulas as memorization, it may become an unpleasant and, worse, a difficult task. Instead, think of formulas as shorthand explanations of the relationships between important financial concepts, between prices and interest rates, for example. If this is done, the relationships will seem clear and logical, and memorization should prove unnecessary, or at least, less so. \n\nSome people consider themselves wordrather than number-persons. Think of numbers as words! Indeed, they are linguistically ",
    "meaningful. Mathematical symbols are a shorthand way of saying something that can also be said – at greater length – in words. \n\nOver the course of the semester, the student will be exposed to numerous mathematical formulae. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 44 \n\n 44 \n\n\n Do not worry about your difficulties in mathematics; I can assure you mine are still even greater. \n\n -Albert Einstein \n\n45 Kenneth S.

    "and are thus not static like the balance sheet; think of it instead as a moving picture, rather than as a photograph. The income statement will reflect cumulative data for a period ending on a certain date. The “period” has a starting and ending date; it may cover a year, halfyear, quarter, or even a month. \n\nOver the course of the period, the numbers, whether they be revenues or expenses, will grow only larger. The sole exception to this is the profit figures, including gross profits, earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), and net income. These data may go either up or down depending on the relative growth of the revenues and expenses that make up those “net” figures. That is, if revenues grew less than expenses over a period, the net profit may go down over time. Take note that expenses are bracketed numbers to indicate that they are subtractions from revenue in order to arrive at profits. \n\nAgain, all other entries are the result of the accountant’s summarization of revenue and ",
    "expense bookkeeping entries, which only grow in size over time (with some few exceptions). Profits are merely the calculation of differences between revenues and expenses in the summary income statement. If expenses grow faster than revenues, profits may decrease in time. \n\nIn contrast, balance sheet numbers will change, in theory, \n\n51 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 51 \n\n\n Key Terms: \n\n Common Size Statements \n\ndaily, and may either increase or decrease. At the year’s end, the “books are closed” and all the income statement numbers revert to zero; we start all over again. The balance sheet, in contrast, never reverts to zero; the company always has some assets and liabilities. A very simple income statement will look something like the following: \n\n XYZ Corp. Income Statement for the Year Ending 12.31.XX \n\nYou must note that expenses are bracketed as they are reductions (subtractions) to revenue in arriving at the profits numbers, i.e., Gross Profits, EBIT, and Net Income. \n\nThe key connection b",
    "etween the income statement and balance sheet has largely to do with “addition to retained earnings.” When the books are “closed” at year’s end, this addition (or deduction) is transferred to “retained earnings” in the bal\n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 52 \n\n\nance sheet; the income statement is “closed out,” and everything in the income statement reverts back to zero. If dividends are paid when there is a loss, the cash used to pay the dividends will have to come from (past years’) retained earnings. “Retained earnings” represent the accumulation of historically retained profits, which were not paid out as dividends, but instead were retained by the corporation, since the corporation’s inception. \n\nAs an accountant (or financial analyst), you may think of revenues as credits (right hand) and expenses as debits (left hand) of the “T-accounts” to which reference was made in the prior chapter. Think of the income statement as part of the balance sheet’s equity section, which is also",
    " a credit balance account. When numbers are compared to a base figure, in this case either “total revenues” or “Net Income,” the analysis may be referred to as “Vertical Analysis.” This makes the analysis from one company to another simpler. Matters having to do with the relative magnitude of the data from one company to another are thereby neutralized. Such analysis utilizes **Common Size Statements** , where figures are represented in percentage terms, as in the income statement above. Common size statements are also (very occasionally) used for Balance Sheets. \n\nGetting back to debits and credits, at year’s end, the accountant debits the income statement for an amount equal to the “addition to retained earnings.” Remember that the Income Statement is a credit balance statement. This debiting enables the accountant to set the income statement back to zero. (Again, the balance sheet never reverts to zero, except in the extreme case of bankruptcy liquidation.) S/he then credits the bal",
    "ance sheet’s retained earnings account for this same amount. That is how retained \n\n53 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n Credit Sales \n\n S, G, & A \n\nearnings grow (or decrease when there is a loss and retained earnings are thus negative) over time. The additions to earnings should be reinvested by a good management in profitable assets for corporate growth purposes. \n\n“EBIT” may also be referred to as “operating earnings.” As you will see, we will differentiate between operating earnings, i.e., earnings generated from the firm’s business activities, and other non-operating income. There are a few other basic things that the financial analyst must keep in mind relative to the Income Statement. \n\n**Credit sales** (on the income statement) are recorded as accounts receivable (on the balance sheet) – until the receivables are collected. This is typical of accrual accounting, as opposed to cash accounting, the latter of which recognizes a sale only when cash is exchanged. At the time of a credit sale, c",
    "redit sales are “credited” on the books, and accounts receivable are debited. When the customer pays, say in 30 days, the account receivable is credited and the cash account is debited. \n\nSelling expenses include advertising, salesperson’s salaries, and “freight-out” paid on shipments to customers; an exception is “freight-in” payments, which are paid on shipments to the firm and are included in COGS (cost of goods sold). General and administrative expenses have to do with: clerical and executive offices salaries, outside professional services, telephone and internet, postage, and office equipment depreci\n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 54 \n\n\n Depreciation Imputable \n\nation. **Selling, General, and Administrative** expenses are also known as **S, G, & A**. \n\n**Depreciation** , if **imputable** to inventory production, will be included in COGS. By “imputable,” it is meant that the accountant can objectively ascribe a specified dollar amount of depreciation to a specified dollar amo",
    "unt of production. Imputable means that units produced can be associated and measured with mathematical certainty and precision to units of production. This figure would be added to COGS, rather than reported separately lower down on the Income Statement. \n\nFor example, if an equipment manufacturer warrants that a $1 million-dollar machine (at cost) will produce one million units and then need to be scrapped, we can safely say that each unit produced includes one dollar’s worth of depreciation. This may happen in the case of depreciable equipment, but not with the plant. Otherwise, i.e., if not imputable, depreciation will be reflected separately and _visibly_ below the gross profit line. \n\nThis makes matters confusing to the reader. Depreciation may be included “above” (within COGS) and/or “below” the gross profits line (as “depreciation expense”). If the former, it will be included _within_ the COGS number; if not, it should be reflected as a separate line item lower down the income ",
    "statement. \n\n55 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n EBIT Operating Earnings \n\n**EBIT** or **Operating Earnings** should be viewed as a kind of dividing line within the income statement. Everything “above the line,” has to do with the firm’s basic running of the business, or operating revenues and expenses. Those items that appear “below the line” may include numerous non-operating items. Such items may include interest on debt, a profit or loss from the sale of an asset, or the financial outcome of litigation. Interest (on debt) has to do with a financial matter; this is not a matter having to do with the running of the business, but instead, with the decision as to how the firm’s assets are financed, in this case with debt rather than with equity. Analytically, it is important to the financial analyst to differentiate between operating and non-operating; we shall depend on this differentiation often. \n\nTaxes are based on earnings before taxes (EBT), which are not always shown on income statements as",
    " a separate line item. Here, EBT, i.e., EBIT ($4,500) less interest expense ($500), but before taxes, equals $4,000. You should also note that taxes were calculated using a 30% tax rate (i.e., a rate arbitrarily chosen for this example), i.e., $4,000 × 30% = $1,200. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 56 \n\n\n57 Kenneth S.

    "\n\n## 3.4 Financial Statements: \n\n## Interpretation \n\nFinancial Statements are fraught with interpretive problems, due to accrual accounting methods, emanating from historical bias, arbitrary choice of one or another cost method, and the use of estimates and reserves, all of which are _legitimate applications_ of “generally accepted accounting principles.” The larger the corporation, the more susceptible its financial statements are to misleading data for the financial analyst to decipher and comprehend. \n\nAccounting presentations complicate analysis, and in particular make difficult the use of analytic financial ratios, which are compiled from the accounting data. Hence, financial analysis is not straightforward, as it would otherwise be if the numerical bases of the accounting data were themselves not subject to variation over time and from firm to firm, and thus to – interpretation! \n\n**Historical bias** – In most, but not all cases, asset cost is recorded by the accountant based on ",
    "invoiced, historical values.Such costs are determined at a point in time and are not adjusted upward later for changing, and possibly increasing, market values. (These assets may then be depreciated, adding still further to the difficulty in interpretation.) \n\nFor example, in the case of long-term assets, a building may be built (or purchased) at a (historical) cost of $1 million dollars. Another, virtually identical building, which \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 60 \n\n 60 \n\n\nmay be built (or purchased) by the same company some years later could have a cost of $2 million; the newer building costs more due to inflation and/or market conditions. The accountant will not necessarily show the details of the original costs of each property and the respective depreciation schedules for each property separately. The accountant will carry the building’s value at its original cost, and at a combined sum, in this case of $3 million, leaving the reader of the data with a kind of mixed bag of",
    " information. Secondly, the depreciation expense will be based on this original value. \n\nMarket values of buildings often, in fact, exceed the recorded, “book” carrying values, i.e., historical cost minus accumulated depreciation. The accountant will not adjust the carrying value of such an asset upward, thereby making it difficult to know the asset’s, and therefore the company’s, true worth. \n\nThis is not an issue where current assets are concerned. It certainly does not apply to cash or accounts receivable; these values do not change. (Under certain narrowly defined circumstances, cash equivalents, a.k.a., “marketable securities” values may be adjusted.) Inventory is generally not marked down in value and never marked up, under accounting rules. \n\n**Estimates** – This too will be illustrated (below) with the use of the (same) example of long-term asset accounting. We will examine both the asset’s “salvage value” and the asset’s estimated “life,” both of which are estimated. This leav",
    "es ample room for “judgment” and, hence, earnings manipulation. Other examples may also pertain. \n\n61 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n**Reserves** – For example, management has some leeway in setting up loss accounts or “reserves,” e.g., for “uncollectible accounts receivable,” better known as “allowance for doubtful accounts.” We will not demonstrate this phenomenon; suffice it to say that this is a notable problem where accounting “manipulation” is concerned. While reserves have been listed here as a category by itself, the reader may also think of it as an example of an estimate. \n\n**Arbitrary use of cost or other methods** – The accountant (together with company management) has _alternatives_ regarding the manner in which s/he may choose to “cost” certain items. This will be illustrated (below) with respect to inventory (a “current asset”) and long-term asset accounting, including plant and equipment. You must recall that “property,” i.e., land cannot be depreciated. \n\nAn external financial an",
    "alyst must dig below the surface in order to understand the accountant’s summary of the corporation’s ledgers. He must also have a deep understanding of the nature of the industry in which the corporation operates. A good place to start is by reading the accountant’s footnotes and thoroughly understanding the firm’s GAAP reporting policies. “GAAP” refers to “generally accepted accounting principles,” which are the rules to which accountants must adhere. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 62 \n\n\n## 3.5 The Audit \n\nNow that we know what financial statements are, and what set of problems may ensue in readings statements, it is important to know well what the accountant’s role relative to the production of the statements is. Certified Public Accountants (C.P.A.s) examine, i.e., “audit,” the books, ledgers, and records of corporations in order to ascertain the data entries’ veracity and accuracy, and prepare _summary_ financial statements such as those we have seen in our Balance Sheet an",
    "d Income Statement discussions.The statements are, once again, _summaries_ of myriad, and often complex, transactions that occurred within the corporation over the course of the stated period – for the Income Statement, or “as of” a date noted – in the case of the Balance Sheet. \n\nThe auditors will present one of four possible “opinions” about the statements. The analyst should examine the opinion for information concerning the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the statements’ data prior to reading the statements themselves. \n\n1. **Unqualified Opinion:** This is the ideal opinion     and is considered a “complete audit.” The     results are satisfactory, and the statements are     “fairly presented” in the language of the auditor/     accountant. \n\n2. **Unqualified Opinion with Explanatory Para-**     **graph:** This may be a complete audit, but the     auditor believes that additional information is \n\n63 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 63 \n\n\n required. \n\n3. **Qualified Opinion:** In general, the ",
    "statements     are fairly presented with an important exception     that does not affect the statements as a whole.     This generally occurs when there is an unjusti-     fied deviation from “Generally Accepted     Accounting Principles,” or GAAP. This opinion     falls short of “Adverse.” \n\n4. **Adverse Opinion:** The auditor does not feel     that the statements taken as a whole fairly pre-     sent the corporation’s financial position in con-     formity with GAAP accounting. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 64 \n\n\n## 3.6 Perpetual Inventory Accounting \n\nThere are two such counting (“Accounting”) methods for inventory – “perpetual” and “periodic.”A perpetual inventory counting system is usually used where the inventory units are few in number, and high in unit cost. It thus pays for the firm’s management to spend some extra resources in knowing exactly how many yachts, for example, it has in the showroom. A one-unit difference is substantial. Under this system, the firm knows –",
    " at all times– the dollar value of its inventory. There are certain methods under which a perpetual system accounts for its inventory, including “ **specific identification,** ” whereby each physical inventory unit is associated with its own specific cost. \n\nIn contrast, a periodic inventory system is effective where units are numerous and relatively cheap. Management is not going to be able to justify the extra effort required to know whether there are ten or eleven blue pens in stock, more or less. It will do, instead, a _periodic_ , probably annually, physical audit of what’s down there in the warehouse. When a physical audit is done, the counting is done in units, rather than in dollars. Thus, the ascription of units to dollars is subject to methodological choice. \n\nWhen a company uses a periodic system, there are management choices under legitimate accounting rules by which the accountant may record the ending inventory balance and, hence, cost of goods sold figures – in dollars. ",
    "We will illustrate all this below. Upon the completion of which \n\n65 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 65 \n\n\nanalysis, the analyst’s relevant interpretive issues should become clear. \n\nThe differences in the numbers presented, and the related management strategies as related to the choice of cost method, are potentially markedly different. Let’s read on. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 66 \n\n\n## 3.7 Periodic Inventory Analysis: Ending \n\n## Inventory and Cost of Goods Sold \n\nLet’s assume a company’s books reflect the following accounting data: \n\nWe know the beginning inventory dollar figure because it is carried over from the prior period’s ending value as noted on the Balance Sheet. The purchasing manager will have loads of invoices (bills) for all the purchases made in the period, so that figure is also known. Adding beginning inventory and purchases together, we get the total amount of goods that were available for sale during the period. If we subtract the ending inventory from the goods ava",
    "ilable number, we get the “cost of goods sold,” which will be noted on the Income Statement. \n\nHow do we know what the dollar value of the ending inventory is if we are not using a specific identificationtype inventory accounting system? When the inventory manager conducts a monthly, or periodic, physical audit, s/he counts inventory units and not dollars. How does the accountant translate units into dollars for valuing the ending inventory? \n\n67 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 67 \n\n\n**Note** : COGS include raw materials, freight-in, electricity, and may also include “imputable” labor and depreciation. \n\n Do not look at the container, but at what is inside. \n\n- Famous Hebrew saying _Don’t judge a book by its cover._ \n\n- Another famous saying \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 68 \n\n\n## 3.8 Units to Numbers: FIFO and LIFO \n\nIf most businesses “do” inventory _periodically_ (rather than _perpetually_ ) for practical reasons, by quite literally, physically counting (ending) inventory units, usually ",
    "monthly, how does the accountant translate the ending inventory units counted into dollars? As we shall see below, management and its accountants have ample discretion regarding choice of inventory costing method. \n\nIn the following illustration for the two most popular costing methods, the company has started the year with one unit of inventory carried at a cost of $100. You will note that the costs go up in time, reflecting an inflationary environment. It is also assumed that only one identical inventory item is being counted. \n\n Alternate Solutions to the Ending Inventory Problem \n\nIn the chart below, you will find alternate solutions to the Ending Inventory Problem when the accountant employs either of two popular costing methods: FIFO (First In, First Out) and LIFO (Last In, First Out). A detailed step-by-step explanation of the chart is found on the next page. Before flipping to the next page, see if you are able to decipher \n\n69 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 69 \n\n\nthe table on your own. I",
    "mmediately following the table is a discussion of the differing results of the two methods. You will note that the choice of method materially affects the Cost of Goods Sold and Ending Inventory values, and therefore all the other values in the table as well. \n\nClearly, a firm will adopt LIFO if it wishes to reduce inflated, “windfall” profits, and hence taxes, in an inflationary environment. LIFO will consequently reduce inventory assets on the balance sheet and make relevant ratios, and hence loan prospects, possibly less attractive to banks who wish to see more assets against which loans may be made and, possibly, secured. Management and its accountants have to weigh the offsetting considerations of one or the other costing method. \n\nTake note that inventory is part of current assets and “working capital” (WC). WC = Current Assets less Current Liabilities. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 70 \n\n\n## 3.9 Inventory Costing Calculations: A \n\n## Closer Look at the COGS and Ending \n\n#",
    "# Inventory Computations \n\nFirst, it must be recognized that the sales amount is independent of any costing method. For every sale, there is an invoice, and the dollar amount is not at all subject to any choice of accounting inventory costing method. \n\nUnder FIFO, the first-in were assumed to be the first-out. So, the cost of goods sold (COGS) figure was the sum of the first four (since four units were sold) costs: $100 + 150 + 200 + 250 = $700. The income statement will show a $700 COGS number as a deduction from sales to arrive at the gross profit of $2,000 – 700 = $1,300. This left $300 in the ending inventory on the balance sheet. Notice that $700 + 300 = $1,000 or the entire inventory cost. \n\nUnder LIFO, we must take the last-in, first-out order to compute the sum of the units sold and to arrive at the COGS number. Therefore, we add in reverse chronological order: $300 + 250 + 200 + 150 = $900. The ending inventory will be the first unit acquired, costing $100. Again, the two numb",
    "ers add up to the sum of the inventory cost: $100 + 900 = $1,000. Gross profits will be lower: $2,000 – 900 = $1,100. Taxes are based on profits. In an inflationary environment, taxes payable will therefore be lower. \n\nAssuming inventory costs rise as often happens when there is inflation, FIFO will always produce a higher gross profit. \n\n71 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 71 \n\n\nWhen corporations expect high inflation (as occurred in the 1970s and in the early 2020s), many will switch to LIFO in order to reduce taxes. Companies pay higher taxes when profits are higher, as might be the case using FIFO, assuming all else equal. To switch to LIFO, the firm must complete IRS Form 970. The corporation cannot go back and forth from one method to the other as the wind blows. You will find the form on the Internet. \n\nThe company will prefer LIFO to reduce taxes. It will prefer FIFO to report higher inventory levels and thus show “more” assets to lenders and shareholders. Well, which of the two is preferab",
    "le in the end? It is permissible for the company to maintain two sets of books, one for filing taxes to the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) and the other for “reporting.” Moreover, it can use varying methods for different inventory items – FIFO for this and LIFO for that. How do you like that?! \n\nOnce again, a company may use one inventory costing method for one inventory item, and a different method for another item. In the end, the various items will be lumped together on one inventory line on the Balance Sheet and reflected as such in COGS. There might be a footnote indicating that inventory was valued using both FIFO and LIFO (and perhaps still another method), but further details may be absent. Talk about confusing! \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 72 \n\n\n Key Terms: \n\n## 3.10 Inventory Accounting Issues: LIFO \n\nOf course, the previous example was “loaded” in that purchase costs rose dramatically over time. In reality, prices tend often to rise with inflation, so the direct",
    "ion of the results in actuality would not be affected. If, in fact, costs declined over the considered periods, the direction of the results would be exactly reversed, and your choice of method, if you anticipated this alternate outcome, would be different accordingly. Here are some relevant upcoming questions. \n\n1. What is meant by “LIFO Base”? \n\n2. What is the effect of costing units sold from the     base? \n\n3. There is a technical problem in connection with     interim reporting under LIFO (in FIFO too). \n\nUsing the foregoing example, imagine that the firm –indefinitely into the future –regularly purchased four units and sold four units. Imagine also that there continued to be some inflation. \n\n A firm cannot accurately provide its LIFO inventory figure until it closes the books on the period. More specifically, the firm cannot figure the Cost of Goods Sold, and therefore its LIFO inventory until it has, quite literally, made the last \n\n73 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 73 \n\n\n LIFO base \n\ninv",
    "entory purchase and thus knows the costs of units acquired. \n\nIt would be conceivable that after some time, inventory costs and sales prices would be quite high, say $20 per unit – theoretically. Still, that one very “old” unit, which is being carried at a historical (ancient!) cost, would reflect a very low “cost basis” of, say $1, representing the inventory’s **LIFO Base**. (See the example on the next page.) If many years later, the firm suddenly then sold five units, it would dig into or “cost out” its LIFO base and reflect a very high profit for that item. This now high profit on that unit would be contrary to the firm’s motivation for adopting LIFO in the first place, which is to minimize profits and consequently its tax liabilities. \n\nBy example, let’s say the firm is on a calendar year fiscal cycle. It cannot know in the interim, say, in November, what the December year-end inventory shall be. In our earlier case, the fourth unit purchased is the first out and first charged to ",
    "COGS. The third acquired is the second to go, etc. We count backwards starting with the last one in! We cannot know what the last one’s cost is – until the last one _is_ in! (True, this problem pertains to FIFO, but is less worrisome analytically.) An illustration of this problem follows on the next page. \n\n Note: \n\n You should be aware that Cost of Goods Soldrepresents the cost of inventory, which passes through the income state\n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 74 \n\n\n ment when sales are recognized, and includes raw materials, “imputable” labor and depreciation, freight-in, and possibly more. “Imputable” refers to measurable costs that can \n\n- with certainty – be related to production, in addition to the otherwise explicit inventory costs. \n\n Suppose you have a widget making machine, which costs $1,000,000 and the manufacturer warrants that it has an expected life of producing one million units, after which it must be scrapped. Under this circumstance, the cost accountant may impu",
    "te $1 of depreciation to each unit of inventory. Otherwise, depreciation would be shown separately, i.e., lower down on the income statement, as illustrated in the sample income statement earlier. \n\n75 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n## 3.11 LIFO Base Illustration \n\nXYZ Corp. costs its inventory on a LIFO basis due to the cost and price inflation its product continuously manifests. \n\nIn the first year illustrated, let’s call it “20X1,” the company purchased 5 units. It sold 4 units, leaving the oldest unit to be carried forward as the _LIFO Base Inventory_ to the next year, “20×2.” See the table below. \n\nEach year going forward, it continues to purchase 4 units and sell 4 units. Therefore, the LIFO Base, initially costed at $1, carries over until “20×5.” The revenue the company receives equals the average of the last price in the current and prior years. The last price, i.e., the price at which the last unit was sold, in “20X0” was $2. Due to the high LIFO costing method, the gross profits remain ",
    "low, thereby minimizing taxes. Had it done its inventory on a FIFO basis, its gross profits would have been slightly higher. (You can figure this out.) \n\nIn the year, 20×5, the company sells all 5 units that were available for sale. The last unit sold was at a price of $22 and its cost, based on LIFO, was only $1. The company would therefore book a high, “windfall” profit on that unit, contrary to the intent of LIFO, which is to keep (taxable) profits low. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 76 \n\n 76 \n\n\nThe purpose of using _LIFO Inventory Accounting_ is to reduce gross profits and thus taxes. We have seen that selling product from the _LIFO Base_ will negate this objective. To avoid this problem, management should order a 6th unit in 20×5 so that the LIFO Base is not costed out. In doing so, management is “manipulating” the effect of its inventory costing method. \n\nRemember, this is accounting fiction in the sense that the costs are unrelated to the actual age of the units. A good m",
    "erchandiser would have long ago moved out any product that is subject to physical aging. \n\n77 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n## 3.12 Accounting for Long-term Assets: \n\n## Straight-Line Depreciation (For \n\n## Reporting Purposes Only) \n\nThe following pages represent three depreciation-costing method alternatives for plant (i.e., buildings) or equipment, which are acceptable for reporting purposes (only). Remember that “property,” i.e., land, is not depreciated. There is an entirely different set of methods required for tax accounting, which we shall not cover herewith. The following methods are unacceptable for Tax accounting. \n\nThe first method we shall outline is called “straight line.” Under this method, we expense on the income statement the same amount of depreciation each year. If, for instance, the asset is _estimated_ to have a five-year life, as in this example, we shall depreciate 1/5 or 20% of the asset yearly. This ratio will be applied against (i.e., multiplied by) the difference betwe",
    "en the property’s historical cost and its estimated salvage value. (Note the key word: “estimated,” which is used here for the second time.) Herein we shall refer to this difference in the two numbers as the “depreciable amount,” a phrase, which we use here, but which you shall not find popularly used elsewhere. \n\nLet’s assume the following: \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 78 \n\n 78 \n\n\nAs you read this and the next two examples, remember that “Salvage Value” does not apply to buildings but only to equipment. Also remember that property, i.e., land, cannot be depreciated. \n\nIn “year zero,” which means “now” (see table below), the asset shall be carried on the balance sheet at its original, historical cost of $1,500,000. Each subsequent year, we shall depreciate 1/5, or 20% of the difference between the cost and the salvage value, this difference being: $1,500,000 – $500,000 = $1,000,000. Thus, the depreciation expense is: $1,000,000 ÷ 5 = $200,000 each year. As the asset balance is",
    " depreciated on the balance sheet and the depreciation is expensed on the income statement, the carrying balance of the asset is reduced by $200,000 each year, until – after five years in this case – the building or equipment is sold for its estimated salvage value. Should the asset be sold for more or less than its salvage value, the accountant will record an “unusual” or “nonrecurring” profit or loss accordingly. \n\n79 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n## 3.13 Accounting Entries for \n\n## Depreciation \n\nThe following represents the accounting book entries for straight-line depreciation in the second year (from the prior page), by way of example. \n\n (000) \n\nIncome Statement Book Entry \n\nDepreciation Expense (dr) $200 \n\nBalance Sheet Book Entries (End of second Year) \n\nNote above that the debits are indented to the left, and the credits are more to the right. That’s as it should be. \n\nBalance Sheet Appearance \n\nThe balance sheet, at the end of the second year, will contain the following items: \n\nYou w",
    "ill recall that equities are credit balance accounts. As noted earlier, you should think of the income statement as \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 80 \n\n 80 \n\n\npart of the equity section of the balance sheet. This is not a stretch as retained earnings are derived from the income statement, i.e., when the “addition to retained earnings” are transferred to the balance sheet – at year’s end, at the time that the books are closed. Therefore, think of revenues as credits, and expenses as debits. \n\n A wise man’s questions contain half the answer. -Solomon ibn Gabirol \n\n81 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n## 3.14 Accelerated \n\n## Depreciation Methods: \n\n## Sum-of-the-Years' Digits (For reporting \n\n## purposes only) \n\nThere are two more methods, which we shall examine, both of which may be referred to as “accelerated” depreciation methods because in the early years there will be more depreciation expense than in the later years. \n\nYou’ll remember that the ratio we used in the given example for Straig",
    "ht Line was 20%. Under “Sum-of-the-years’ digits” (SOYD), we apply a new ratio against the $1,000,000 depreciable amount. \n\nIn the denominator for the SOYD ratio, we calculate the sum of the years’ digits, which, in this five-year example is: 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 15. \n\nIn the numerator, we use the reverse order of the years, starting with five, and then going backwards each year. So, in year one, we expense 5/15 of $1,000,000 = $333,333, and reduce the balance accordingly. In the second year the ratio is 4/15. In the third, year the ratio is 3/15, or, as it happens, the same 20% that we used in the straightline method; you’ll note that the depreciation expense after this third year will be less than under straight-line. At this rate, you will note that after five years we will have depreciated 15/15 or 100% of the depreciable amount. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 82 \n\n 82 \n\n\n83 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n## 3.15 Accelerated Depreciation \n\n## Methods: Double/Declining Balance \n\n## (For ",
    "reporting purposes only) \n\nUnder Double/Declining Balance (D/DB), we combine two concepts, hence the slash in the name. That’s the way to remember what this method is about. First of all, we depreciate at _double_ the straight-line rate, which in this case, would be 2 × 20%, or 40% per year. \n\nIf we do this doubling of the annual rate, we would have depreciated the entire asset in half the asset’s estimated life, rather than in the full five years; or alternatively, we would have depreciated twice the asset’s original cost over the entire five years. Either alternative is clearly incorrect and unacceptable. \n\nInstead, we depreciate twice the straight-line rate, not against the depreciable amount, but against the _declining balance_ , ignoring salvage value. That’s the second concept: the use of a declining balance. So, in the first year, we depreciate 40% of $1,500,000, or $600,000, leaving a new balance of $900,000. In the second year, we depreciate 40% of the declining balance of $90",
    "0,000, which is $360,000. \n\nIn this example (and not necessarily in all examples), if we continue to depreciate at this rate, we will go below the salvage value in the third year. At this point, the accountant will either depreciate the balance of $40,000 in \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 84 \n\n 84 \n\n\none-fell swoop, or, more likely, straight-line the $40,000 balance over the remaining three years. (S/he could also adjust the salvage value lower.) In straight-lining the $40,000 remaining balance, rather than deducting $40,000, one may deduct $13,333 ($40,000 ÷ 3) for each of the last three years. \n\nD/DB is even more accelerated than SOYD, as you may have already noticed. The depreciation expense is greater in the early years. \n\nYour income statement and balance sheet will reflect the following: \n\n85 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n## 3.16 Comparative Summary of \n\n## Depreciation Methods \n\nGiven: \n\nStraight Line: \n\nAccelerated Depreciation Methods: \n\n- Sum-of-the-Years’ Digits: \n\n- Double/Dec",
    "lining Balance: \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 86 \n\n 86 \n\n\nAgain, D/DB is the most accelerated of the various methods. The finance student needs to have some sense of the “distortions” that accounting data present to him as a result of (management and the accountants’) “choice,” and its impact on financial analysis. In addition to the alternate depreciation methods presented in this example, we may also note that the salvage value is an estimate. These arbitrary choices and estimates present alternative “looks”for the financial statements – and interpretative difficulties for the analyst. \n\nFinal Note: The three methods covered in the last pages are NOT acceptable for Tax Accounting. There, a wholly different system must be implemented by dint of a 1986 law. The tax system is called “Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System,” or simply “MACRS.” This method will not be covered here. \n\n87 Kenneth S.

Analysts rely mightily on accounting data. Thus, we must know what is going on in the corporate accounting world. Reported earnings are subject to all kinds of accounting chicanery, and it is earnings that lar",
    "gely drive stock prices! \n\n Thus, firms have an incentive to “manage earnings” in order to guide analysts’ earnings expectations downward and, thereby, report actual earnings that were greater than analysts’ previous consensus expectations. Corporations cannot legally inform analysts what their exact earnings expectations are, so they employ various mechanisms to guide the analysts. \n\n Stock prices, in the wake of this management, will react \n\n1.

Such stocks will provide higher returns than those of firms who do not beat expectations, 2 as investors may believe that beating expectations signals positive trends in future earnings. Stocks of corporat",
    "ions that miss expected earnings are penalized asymmetrically; markets penalize stocks more for missed earnings than they reward companies for positive surprises. 3 \n\n Not all potentially misleading accounting data are intentionally “managed” by the firm and its accountants. In some cases, GAAP accounting provides no discretionary opportunities for earnings management, e.g., the choice of either FIFO or LIFO, yet the data may nonetheless not represent true values. An example that we discussed had to do with historical bias. In this case, there is only one way in which a long-term asset can be “booked,” and hence its reported asset and tax depreciation figures are based on that historical cost. The historical record is unlikely to be realistic. \n\n Beyond these examples, inventory can be written down on a discretionary basis within reasonable limits. Reported estimates and reserves can be manipulated within reasonable parameters. Indeed, reserves are fertile ground for manipulation. In o",

As noted, managed manipulation of accrual accounting methods will lead to varying presentations of the same economic phenomena. AEM, thus, involves the use of the accounting system itself in order to influence a desired result.On the other hand, we have also provided some illustrations of **Accrual Earnings Management** (AEM) in the manner of Inventory Costing and _Reported_ Depreciation Accounting Methods (as opposed to tax d",
    "epreciation methods). AEM has to do with GAAP-permitted choices. \n\nTiming the sale of inventory in order to boost earnings in a targeted period. Another opportunity for earnings management comes from **Real Earnings Management (REM)**. In this case, a firm may engage in certain actual transactions in order to accomplish a particular accounting outcome. Specifically, the firm could structure transactions by setting them at varying discretionary points in time (“timing”) in order to achieve a pre-set accounting result. Here are some examples of REM: \n\n1. Delaying fixed asset maintenance expenses. \n\n2. Delaying operating expenses, including adver-     tising and R&D. \n\n3. Putting off salary increases and the payment of     bonuses. \n\n99 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n Public Expectations Management \n\n Fraud \n\n4.

We will let you decide if AEM, REM, and PEM legitimately circumvent accounting rules or not, and whether you may consider its use ethical \n\n- or not! Third, firms have an incentive to manage the public’s future earn- ings expectations in such manner as ana- lysts and investors expect less and get more in earnings in reality than had been expected. That is not to say that all companies, at all times, will manage earnings expectations downward. By communicating press releases, meeting with analysts, and giving TV interviews, a firm can engage in **Public Expectations Manage- ment (PEM)**. Of course, such manipulations, if that is the correct phrase here, are not affected by the accountant. \n\nStill a final manipulation of earnings may come from fraudulent accounting practices. \n\nIn sum, firms can employ any and all of the following four means of accounting chicanery: 1.

These have more to do with accounting fraud than the legitimate accounting choices enumerated earlier. \n\n Channel Stuffing – Companies sell ",
    "large amounts of goods to distributors in order to book large profits. Under SEC accounting, it is permissible to book sales for shipped product, less a reasonable allowance for returns. However, channel stuffers may not be able to make reasonable estimates and would therefore be required to defer revenue recognition until return estimates may be projected. This may result in deferring revenue for months. Stuffing occurs when vendors ship merchandise in advance of scheduled shipment dates without buyers’ acquiescence. \n\n Bill and Hold – Revenue is booked even though the product may not have been shipped and payment may not actually be due for a long period. For example, Sunbeam sold \n\n1. The following section was derived from a report in the New York Times on     December 4, 1999, p. C4. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 102 \n\n 102 \n\n\ncharcoal grills in the winter, although they were not to be shipped until springtime; after a change in management, books were restated to eliminate ",
    "the relevant revenue and profit. This arrangement would be allowed, under SEC accounting, provided the _buyer_ requested it; the buyer must also have a good business reason for the request. Further, the goods must be either already assembled or otherwise ready for shipment before revenue is recognized. \n\n**_Internet Sales_** – If an internet site is acting as agent for, as an example, an airline ticket sale, it may only book the revenue it earns. This revenue may be only a commission rather than the full value of the ticket. If it acts as principal, it may book the larger amount as revenue and another amount as expense (the portion which it must return to the airline), showing the net result – which would, in effect, be the commission. Internet companies whose stock prices are sensitive to “top-line” growth prefer to recognize sales as principals. Principal transactions are permitted by the SEC provided the company took title to the product before shipment and “has the risks and reward",
    "s of ownership, such as the risk of loss for collection, delivery, or returns…”. \n\nDiscussion Question: What are the moral and legal differences between “fraud” and the creative use of accounting methods and assumptions? \n\n103 Kenneth S.

Here are some further issues in connection with expenses. The analyst must always be on the alert. \n\n Stock options provided to executives are not accounted for as expenses, thereby giving earnings a boost because there is no associated expensing to salary. According to a study by Ms. Pat McConnell of Bear Stearns, in 1999 net income of the S & P would have been 6% lower",
    " had employee stock options been reflected as an expense. Options will be exercised at below the market’s stock prices resulting in an associated cost to the firm. In 1998 and 1997 the reductions would have been 4% and 3% respectively. \n\n The FASB requires that companies include in their footnotes the effect of options granted after 12/15/94. The full effect of this was first felt in 1999 as many companies’ plans allow options to vest in five years or less. If compa\n\n1.

Obviously, most companies chose the latter. Ms. McConnell found only Boeing and Winn-Dixie, i.e., just two of the 500 S & P companies, that chose to report options as an expen",
    "se. Earnings at 21 companies fell by more than half, if options were expensed; this list includes McDermott International, Yahoo, Autodesk, and Polaroid. Twelve of these companies would have reported a loss, including Micron Technology. She further cites the following declines in earnings due to options: \n\n Health Care Services companies -38% \n\n Computer Networking companies -24% Commercial and Consumer services -21% \n\n Communication Equipment makers -19% \n\nOverall, the S & P 500 growth rate in earnings would decrease from 11% to 9% over the last three years – if options were expensed. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 106 \n\n\n## 4.6 Chapter 4: Review Questions \n\n Chapter 4: Review Questions \n\n1.

Keep in mind that the ",
    "purpose of releasing Financial Statements is to enable effective credit and investment decisions, i.e., decisions regarding the future prospects of a business entity. \n\n Potential and current lenders wish to assess the creditability of the firm and shareholders wish to assess the returns their investments will earn. Will the borrowing corporation be able to make timely interest payments on its debt? Will shareholders receive sufficient dividends and growth in their capital investments, i.e., increases in share prices, to justify owning a portion of this corporation after considering the risks involved? \n\n A good predictor of stock price performance may be book value – assets less liabilities, and earnings. A recent study 1 has found that the usefulness of these predictor variables has become attenuated in recent years, more particularly since the crisis of 2000-2001. A more useful predictor is cash flow. Cash flows are easier to predict than earnings and book values and have greater im",
    "pact on price than the others. \n\n Yet, regulators and the accounting profession continue producing rulings that make reading statements more com\n\n1.

Accrual accounting, despite its flagrant flaws, has become a faith, rather than a science, that sufficiently describes a certain reality. Does one really need to pore through two hundred pages of arcane financial statement information in order to make an investment decision? Isn’t the purpose of a statement to simplify and clarify the financial condition and productivity of the corporation and its management? \n\n Much has changed in recent decades. We now live in a much more technological world. Communications are faster. Investment analysis and its implementation are speedier. When we look at financial statements, little, if anything, has changed for the last one hundred years. Statements look the same; the ac",
    "counts are the same. Doubleentry bookkeeping has not advanced since it was developed in Italy by Luca Pacioli in 1494! Intangibles, including brand names, patents, customer lists, R&D-inprocess, training, and information systems, are not carried on the balance sheet, but usually expensed only as incurred. More and more, investment decisions are made using data outside of the accounting sphere. Clearly, accounting reporting methods need updating 2 . \n\n2. There were two more crises; the Banking Crisis of 2007-2008, and the     COVID-19 outbreak (2020) which led to a market crash, which was NOT     due to any financial causes. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 114 \n\n\n### On Achievement \n\n The secret to getting ahead …is getting started. -Mark Twain \n\n The secret of achievement is to hold a picture of a successful outcome in the mind. –Henry David Thoreau \n\n Ninety-nine percent of the failures come from people… who are in the habit of making excuses. \n\n -George Washington Carver \n\n Sci",

Ratios are basic tools of analysis. It is _very_ important, therefore, that you master the following. \n\nIt is important to understand that _ratios do not provide answers, but instead raise questions_ , which the analyst must then resolve. Questions raised must be investigated. Analyst speculations should be based on knowledge of financial statements, the macroeconomic and industry backgrounds in which the company operates, management profiles, and company history. The ratios themselves are derived from accounting data, which are subject to interpretive issues. \n\nA ratio consists of two numbers, which are compared to one another. “2:1” ( _two-to-one_ ) or “1:3” are ratios. ",
    "In fact, any simple number is a ratio because it can always be compared to one! Fractional numbers also pertain. We may also think of ratios as consisting of a numerator (on the top) and a denominator (on the bottom), e.g., 2/1 and 1/3 above. \n\nNo (financial) ratio means anything by itself – it must be compared to some other datum in order to derive inferences. The means by which the comparison may be made are: \n\n**Longitudinal (Vertical)** : This would involve comparing a \n\n117 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 117 \n\n\nratio for a company at two different points in time. For instance, we may say that IBM’s profit margin last year was 10% versus this year’s 20%. What are the relevant _trends_? Longitudinal analysis data can be effectively diagrammed. \n\n**Cross-Sectional (Horizontal)** : here we would compare two companies on the basis of a selected ratio at the same point in time. This might lead us to conclude, for instance, that one company is more profitable than another at present. \n\nAt times, th",
    "e construction of a financial ratio may involve comparing a Balance Sheet datum with an Income Statement number. This presents a problem in that the former statement is a static, or “as-of” based statement, whereas the latter is a flow, or moving picture. In order to compare apples to apples, i.e., when comparing an Income Statement with a Balance Sheet number, the analyst may choose to use an average number for the Balance Sheet datum in order to make the Balance Sheet number appear more like a “flow.” The average may be calculated in various ways, e.g., by **averaging** two consecutive year-end data, using quarterlies, or, if available, monthlies. \n\nAveraging may be especially warranted in cases where balance sheet data fluctuate widely due to seasonality or other factors. For example, a snow-mobile manufacturer may have much inventory in September and far less inventory in March. In such a case, it may be advised for the analyst to average the inventory number over, say, four quarte",
    "rs. In the pages to follow, we will learn how this averaging is actually done by the analyst – and under what circumstances. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 118 \n\n\nBelow are some important financial ratios, listed by category. When would you utilize certain ratios? How may your choice of ratio vary from sector to sector (or industry to industry)? In many, if not most, instances there is no universal – minimum, maximum or average – “ideal” ratio that relates to all situations. The ideal ratio, if there is such a thing, is a function of numerous variables, including the nature of the industry, the company, the management risk profile, and perhaps the shareholders’ risk profiles and goals as well. \n\nAs we go through the discussion regarding Ratio Analysis, some of you may wish to calculate the generic ratios provided using an example. At the end of Chapter Seven, the reader will find a page entitled “Simple Ratio Analysis Exercise.” That page contains a Balance Sheet and Income Stat",
    "ement for a fictitious company; a ratios worksheet follows on the subsequent page, with the solutions following that page. You may work through the ratios there. \n\nKeep in mind that the actual ratios’ arithmetic calculations are secondary to the primary and underlying understanding of what the actual ratios are in the abstract, and what they mean. Once you understand the ratios themselves, e.g., what it means when we say that “average collections are 32 days,” or that the TIE Ratio should exceed one, the calculations become a matter of a simple arithmetic exercise, a mere changing of the inputted numbers to fixed formulae. That said, you will find a comprehensive exercise, including a Balance Sheet and Income Statement, requiring the calculation of all our Financial Ratios below – in Section #7.5. As you calculate, don’t forget the numerous faults with accounting data! \n\n119 Kenneth S.

    " twenty financial ratios below, the student will, one-byone, calculate the ratios for the example given in the exercise. You will find that the example is constituted by a fictitious company’s Balance Sheet and Income Statement. \n\nWe are going to list 20 ratios – covering six categories– in this section. After this discussion, an exercise in calculating all the ratios is presented so that you may apply what you learned. \n\nThe first category is **liquidity ratios.** The idea of **liquidity** has to do with the ease and speed with which an asset may be converted into cash – without compromising its “true” worth or “intrinsic value.” It must satisfy both conditions in order to be considered liquid. \n\nFor instance, it is possible to sell virtually anything at a “fire–sale price,” if one needs the cash. The question is whether an item worth, say $100, will fetch $100 – or less. If less, we may say that the item is not liquid, as the seller \n\n123 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 123 \n\n\ndid not obtain its",
    " true worth, even though s/he was able to obtain some cash for it. \n\nAn example of a liquid asset would be IBM stock. Let’s say it is trading for $190. Should one wish to sell 100 shares of the stock, s/he would obtain approximately $19,000 for it. However, if I wanted to sell my tie, for which I paid $50, it may be difficult for me to get that amount. Whether you wish to consider the asset’s “value” a matter of its original cost or its “current value,” is a matter of analytic choice and context. \n\nThe notion of liquidity is closely tied to another notion: “marketability.” This has to do with the availability of a market in which purchases and sales may be readily transacted. For instance, the stock market provides IBM common shares with a great deal of marketability. Should I however wish to sell my tie, I would not know where to go to find a “used-tie market.” Real estate markets are dominated by brokers who advertise frequently, and I may easily sell my car to a used car dealer. \n\nI",
    "n the case of your typical corporation, it will not own other companies’ stock. It will instead produce goods and services for sale and profit. Thus, it will regularly carry inventory and accounts receivable, which are reported as “current assets.” The net current assets (current assets less current liabilities), being short-term, are presumably liquid. If the assets are liquid, the firm will be able to quickly convert the assets into cash, which will be used to honor its current liabilities due. If not liquid, the firm will have difficulty paying its current liabilities; it will be said to have a “liquidity problem.” \n\nNow that we know what is meant by liquidity and we \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 124 \n\n\nunderstand that the liquidity notion applies to “net current assets,” let’s quantify the notion by detailing some relevant ratios that put numbers to the idea. The greater the measurable liquidity the less the _risk_ that the firm will not have sufficient funds to defray its ",
    "short-term payment requirements. \n\n**Current Ratio = Current Assets Divided by Current Liabilities = CA ÷ CL** \n\nThe current ratio gauges the extent to which a corporation has the liquidity with which it may honor its short-term obligations or liabilities. Does it have the cash to pay its suppliers when accounts payable are due? Are inventories and accounts receivable _sufficient_ (and liquid) to cover its current liabilities? We will assume, for now that the inventory and accounts receivable are completely liquid. \n\nIt stands to reason that a watermark level for this ratio should be 1:1 or 1x (“one times”); one would not want to see this ratio go below that figure as it would imply that the company does not have sufficient current assets and, hence, the liquidity to meet its current obligations. Many analysts agree that 1.5x or 2x are reasonable figures, but we should be leery of such arbitrary minima. Companies that are very efficient in the manner in which they manage their current ",
    "assets may have current ratios close to 1. In general, ratios will vary from industry to industry. Note that this ratio is affected by the choice of inventory costing method (e.g., FIFO vs. LIFO) because inventory is a constituent of current assets. \n\n125 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\nNote: Working Capital = Current Assets less Current Liabilities. If the current ratio is less than one, the working capital will be negative. (See Ratio Exercise.) \n\n**Quick Ratio (“Acid Test”) = (CA – Inventory) ÷ CL** \n\nSome analysts take a more conservative approach in the assessment of liquidity coverage by _assuming_ that inventory is worthless (even though it may, in fact, not be – or not be entirely) and hence that current liabilities will be covered by all current assets except inventory. Indeed, in some industries inventory quickly becomes obsolete due to technological advances; in other cases, inventory may be easily damaged, or lose its fashion and sales appeal. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 126 ",
    "\n\n\nThe current and quick ratios may be thought of as “coverage” ratios in that they indicate the extent to which liquid assets are adequate to “cover,” or pay off, current liabilities, especially accounts payable and notes payable (i.e., short-term loans). \n\n**Average Collection Period (ACP) = Days sales outstanding (DSO) = (A/R ÷Credit Sales) (360)** \n\n“A/R” stands for Accounts Receivable. This ratio tells the analyst approximately how long it takes the firm to collect its receivables; the ratio is expressed in days. The shorter the collection period, the more liquid the firm’s accounts receivable. \n\nNote that we use credit sales because only credit (and not cash) sales become accounts receivable. This ACP figure may then be compared to the firm’s typical credit terms. If, for argument’s sake, the ACP _exceeds_ the firm’s credit terms, which may be 30 days, the analyst may first assess whether the firm is having collection problems. Alternatively, the analyst may investigate whether t",
    "he firm is acting aggressively in its marketing, and choosing to live with the consequences of some late payments as a result. Perhaps the firm expects that the incremental profits will exceed any losses in its collections. \n\nThis ratio is our first case, so far, of “apples and oranges” in that, here, we note that both income statement and balance sheet numbers appear within the same ratio. This inconsistency needs to be fixed; we ought not to combine one datum from the Balance Sheet, which is a static figure, with another from the Income Statement, which is a flow kind of number, within one ratio. The two are inconsistent with each other. \n\n127 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\nIn such cases as this, what the analyst may choose to do is “average” the balance sheet number. One way of doing this would be by taking this year’s and last year’s yearend numbers and averaging them(i.e., add the two numbers up and divide by two). We could also use quarterlies or, if available, monthlies. In businesses wher",
    "e receivables fluctuate over the course of the year and may thus be either relatively high or low at certain times of year or during certain seasons, it may be better to average the quarterly numbers, if possible. \n\nThis technique would then capture a better sense of movement over the course of the seasonal business cycle and would thus provide a better comparison with the income statement number, which, again, flow over the course of the entire year. If the balance sheet number does not fluctuate – much, or at all – over time, there may be no need for averaging. This choice is at the discretion of the analyst. Compare Companies “A” and “B” in terms of their accounts receivable or inventory levels, as it were, over the course of four quarters. Is anything accomplished by averaging the Balance Sheet numbers for Company A? \n\nYou will also note that (usually) Accounts Receivable will display a smaller number than Sales. Normally, we would expect that accounts receivable are collected more",
    " or less monthly; indeed, _if_ sales terms are 30 days, we \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 128 \n\n\nshould get about 12 collections per year. This is illustrated on the next page. \n\nWe shall also assume a 360-day year, consisting of twelve 30-day rolling months, because most often collections are demanded within 30 days. Some analysts will use a 365-day year on the rationale that Credit Sales accumulate over a 365-day calendar year. It’s your choice, Ms/r. Analyst! \n\nFinal note: If you are analyzing data for just one quarter, you should use 90, rather than 360, as the multiplier for the ACP. For two or three quarters, you will use 180 and 270 respectively. \n\n**Inventory Turnover = COGS ÷ Inventory** \n\nThis ratio tells us how often the inventory “turns over,” that is to say, how often the inventory – in its entirety – is replaced. Would you buy fresh tomatoes from a company whose inventory turnover is 10x a year (or every 36 days)? Note that this ratio is affected by the choice of i",
    "nventory costing method. This ratio has some issues with mixing Balance Sheet and Income Statement numbers, which was discussed the prior section concerning ACP. \n\n129 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n## 5.6 The Income Statement versus the \n\n## Balance Sheet \n\nIt is important to understand how related Balance Sheet and Income Statement numbers may compare with one another, especially when used in a particular ratio. \n\nFor instance, in the Average Collection Period, we compare MONTHLY credit sales (from the Income Statement) to MONTHLY accounts receivable (from the Balance Sheet). Which number is bigger? Take note that the quarterly data for the Credit Sales are cumulative as reported by the accountant. We are also assuming that the receivables are collected in full at each month’s end. Let’s see. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 130 \n\n 130 \n\n\nIn the table above, we show credit sales on a monthly basis for the “Fictitious Company” over the course of the fiscal year ended (FYE) 12.31.20XX. We ar",
    "e assuming that credit terms are 30 days and that all receivables are collected on time. Which number is greater – the credit sales or the accounts receivable? \n\nClearly, after February, Credit Sales, which are cumulative, will exceed accounts receivable. A similar analysis may be applied to the inventory turnover ratio. \n\n131 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n## 5.7 Accounts Receivable Aging \n\n## Schedule \n\nAn aging schedule is an internal, managerial, and confidential document, which shows, account by account, how much money is due the seller from the time of sale, and whether a customer account is “current” or is “past due.” It is a necessary management tool. \n\nThe schedule would provide the external analyst with much more than s/he may otherwise know by alternatively calculating Days Sales Outstanding. It is much more detailed. Unfortunately, the schedule is an internal management document and unavailable to outsiders. \n\nThe customer accounts are listed row by row, either by name or some some ot",
    "her identifier. Since most credit sales require payment within 30 days, the first column shows how much money is due where the sale occurred less than 30 in the past. As you read to the right, you will see uncollected credit sales figures that are more than 30, 60, and 90 days old, and the respective amounts due. Thus, the schedule might look somewhat like the following. In examining the schedule, what might you tentatively conclude about each of the five listed accounts? \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 132 \n\n 132 \n\n\nBy examining this schedule, the analyst may uncover some interesting findings. For instance: \n\n1. ACP/DSO may be higher than the company’s     sales terms due, possibly, to one very large     account skewing the average. It may also be     greater due to the company’s decision to enter a     new geographical or product market, knowing in     advance that such entry will slow down its col-     lections, but expecting that the added profits will     make the expansion ",
    "worthwhile. \n\n2. The analyst may see how many accounts are     current and how many should be written off –     analytically – by the analyst. (Remember: this is     not accounting, so a real “write-off” would be     recorded by the accountant.) \n\n3. This schedule does not tell the reader anything     about the profitability of the accounts (but nei-     ther does the ACP). It could very well be, for     instance, that account #1, which apparently pays     well, is also purchasing very low margin prod-     ucts. While not necessarily of great importance     to the Accounts Receivable manager, the mar-     keting manager may be very interested in prof-     itability. \n\n4. Overall, it appears that the company \n\n133 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n has $425/$700, or 60.7% of its receivables that are “current,” i.e., not past due – assuming 30-days collection terms. \n\n5. The Aging Schedule implies a certain ACP. In     order to calculate the ACP, it is necessary to     know the Credit Sales figure, wh",
    "ich is publicly     available from the company’s Income State-     ment. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 134 \n\n\n## 5.8 Solvency Ratios \n\n**Solvency** has to do with the firm’s ongoing ability to generate sufficient liquidity from Operating Earnings (EBIT) in order to meet its continuing debt-service obligations, particularly interest payments, timely and fully. The two most common solvency ratios have to do with “leverage,” or the extent to which the firm employs debt as a source of capital as opposed to using equity. \n\nSome debt is desirable as it allows the firm’s owners or shareholders to exploit “other people’s money” ( **OPM** ) in order to earn greater profits on a per share basis than they would in the absence of debt, i.e., OPM. Too much debt, however, may be a bad thing as it increases the firm’s riskiness by adding on an increasing requirement to pay interest on the debt. \n\n**“TIE” Ratio = Times Interest Earned (or Interest Coverage) = EBIT ÷ Interest Expense** \n\n**EBIT",
    "** stands for “Earnings before Interest and Taxes.” Over time, a company’s operating earnings (EBIT) may fluctuate, the extent of which fluctuation depends on the company’s business and its industry. For example, a lawnmower (or snowmobile) manufacturer will have high sales and inventory at certain times of year and low at other times; we refer to this phenomenon as “seasonality.” The company’s interest expnses is relatively flat over time because the company does not often borrow and its interest expenses are fixed. \n\n135 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 135 \n\n\nIn any case, this ratio looks at the extent to which EBIT exceeds the interest expense on its debt over time. Is this margin (or buffer) a “safe” amount? (Some analysts will add back depreciation and amortization to EBIT to arrive at “EBITDA” – operating cash flow – on the rationale that interest is paid with cash.) \n\nIn the diagram below, you will find inserted three possible EBIT curves for a fictitious firm; each possibility is represent",
    "ed by a different colored curve.. The “wavier” the EBIT line, the more volatile its operating earnings are/will be over the course of some periods or years. The question is: overall, which curve represents the most secure TIE ratio and why? The implications profoundly relate to the firm’s Solvency! \n\nEBIT may look like a kind of horizontal squiggle, the _squigglyness_ of which depends on the volatility of the firm’s operating earnings. The question then is whether interest expense (the straight horizontal line), which should be relatively flat over time, is above, below, or somewhere in the middle of the squiggle. Interest expense would appear as a horizontal line, since it is relatively flat over time because the company’s level of indebtedness changes little, if at all, over time. \n\nAgain, the company’s EBIT should be sufficiently above the interest expense line, the extent of which differential \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 136 \n\n\ndepends on the nature of the company’s busin",
    "ess and the manner in which the company is managed. A contingency may arise that if EBIT is low relative to (or worse, below) the interest expense, will the firm have the capacity to make the required and timely (cash) payment of interest? Persistent insolvency may lead to bankruptcy. \n\n**Debt ÷ NW** \n\nBy “NW,” we mean “net worth,” or (total) “equity” (remember the basic accounting equation: A – L = NW). Analysts will disagree as to what is meant by “debt.” Some will concern themselves only with long-term liabilities; others will include current liabilities among “Debt.” In most instances, and for our present use, we will refer to “total liabilities” as debt, a reasonable default assumption since Debt + NW = 100% of assets, thus excluding nothing on the Balance Sheet. \n\nWhile one cannot say what the ideal “debt-to-net-worth ratio” ought to be, it is safe to say that as the ratio increases, the company’s ongoing ability to service its debt (i.e., to pay interest in particular) is reduce",
    "d, and the likelihood of bankruptcy increases. In general, the ratio will change from industry to industry. Some industries are characterized by greater indebtedness, or “leverage” than others. We will have more to say about this later. This ratio may be less than or greater than one. In the Balance Sheet to the right, the Debt-to-Net Worth Ratio is 500:500 or 1:1, “one to one.” The Total Assets are $1,000. \n\n137 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n**Debt ÷ TA** \n\nThe default option for defining “debt” is again “total liabilities.” Again, remember that Total Assets = Debt + Equity (TA = D + Eq). In this case, as the ratio increases, the company’s solvency becomes increasingly at risk. \n\nThis ratio should not be thought of as “coverage” ratios, in the same sense that the current and quick ratios are (or for that matter as the TIE ratio is). In the latter cases, we view the adequacy (or inadequacy) of current assets as sufficient \n\n- or not – to pay for the company’s current liabilities. The firm needs ",
    "liquid current assets to pay off its current liabil- ities. \n\nSuch is not the correct manner, in which to interpret the debt ratios. The company does not need its equity to “pay off” its debts! It is incorrect to say that the net worth, or equity, of the company is “adequate” in this sense. The only time that that equity will be used to pay off debt is in the worst case of bankruptcy and (net) asset liquidation! In most cases, you will be analyzing an ongoing enterprise, not a bankrupt one. \n\nInstead, these two debt ratios (D/NW and D/TA) are simply measures of the _magnitude_ of a company’s indebtedness and, as such, are useful in comparison to other companies in its industry, and to itself over time. Does _XYZ Corporation_ have a lot of debt in comparison (or in proportion to) to its industry peers? Is its indebtedness increasing? \n\nA more useful solvency coverage ratio, if you are looking for one that most directly addresses solvency, is the “Times Interest Earned” ratio, above. The",
    " “TIE” ratio provides a \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 138 \n\n\n Leverage \n\ngauge of the company’s ability to pay (i.e., to “cover”) the interest payable (or paid) on its debt. \n\nThe D/TA ratio above would be 500/1,000 or 50%. While the D/NW is more popular, the D/TA ratio gives the analyst an _imaginary_ range of 0-100% of debt in comparison to total assets. The D/NW ratio gives no such reasonable range. In any case, one ratio can be easily inferred from the other. \n\n**Total Assets ÷ Equity** \n\nAnother solvency ratio is D / TA. This ratio will be presented and discussed when we get to the “DuPont Model” somewhat later (see Sections 6.3 and 6.4). \n\n In summary, the more debt a company has relative to either its Equity or its Total Assets, the more leverage it is said to have, by definition. In Physics, a “lever” allows one to get more output with the same input as compared to not using the lever. \n\n### “If at First….” \n\n I can accept failure; everyone fails at something. \n\n I cann",

Each of the foregoing data (without the word “margin”) may be divided by “Total Sales” and use",
    "d cross-sectionally or longitudinally. “Margin” means percentage. For example, gross profit margin = gross profits ÷ sales. \n\nIn discussing liquidity ratios, we agreed that in order to manage liquidity risk the current ratio should be at least one.We can also agree that too high a current ratio may be unhealthy. This is because current assets, especially cash, produce no return. Having inventory sitting around does no good. \n\nA question to ask is: Why has the firm accumulated cash and other current assets rather than investing in more productive, fixed assets? There must be a balance between liquidity on the one hand, and return (see below) on the other. Too much of anything may not be good. \n\nEven though the firm may have high profitability, it does not mean that its cash flow position is strong. One must also examine the solvency ratios, especially the TIE ratio. \n\n143 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 143 \n\n\nThe company may have onerous obligations due to maturing debt and the need for replacemen",
    "t of long-term assets. A growing company may need a great deal of liquidity, in order to support growing sales, which growth would be reflected in growing inventory and accounts receivable. The analyst should also check the firm’s Liquidity. \n\n**Return Measures:** \n\n### We will discuss two important return measures. \n\n### These ratios give the analyst another look at prof\n\n### itability. \n\n ROA = Return on Assets = EBIT ÷ TA \n\nHow well is a firm employing its assets? Return on Assets attempts to gauge this. While many will use net income in the numerator, EBIT is preferable in the sense that operating profits reflect what the assets produce, whereas net income is affected by the firm’s capital structure, i.e., interest expense and particularly taxes, and other possible items not directly associated with the firm’s actual business or “operations.” \n\nROA may be a good tool to judge management’s operating performance and its “asset utilization,” or how efficiently it exploits the firm’s a",
    "ssets. Why may two, otherwise identical companies, have different ROAs? Does one company _manage_ better? Does it motivate its employees better? Are they better trained? Do they work harder or longer hours? Does it employ better technology? \n\n ROE = Return on Equity = NI ÷ Equity \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 144 \n\n\nCommon shareholders are most interested in ROE because that is what they get for their equity investment. They understand that for each dollar of equity invested, they will have a claim on the company’s net income, i.e., its dividends and (additions to) retained earnings. \n\nWhat kind of return is the firm able to produce on its equity? Equity is the result of, not just the company’s past operating performance (EBIT) and its associated accumulation of retained earnings, but management’s capital structure decisions (i.e., the debt/equity ratio) when it had to raise capital in the past. The more debt there is, the less equity; the more interest expense, the less net in",
    "come. EBIT also affects Net Income! \n\nWhile ROA reflects the firm’s effectiveness in producing operating profits, or EBIT, the effective use of leverage, i.e., debt, can increase the firm’s ROE above its ROA. This is not guaranteed; borrowing does not ensure in all instances that ROE > ROA. In addition, “leverage,” i.e., the use of debt ( _OPM_ ), increases the firm’s financial, or solvency, risk. We shall get a glimpse of this when we – soon – look into the DuPont model on the very next page. ROA and Leverage (i.e., the extent to which a firm utilizes debt) are inter-related. Stay tuned. \n\nROE may be a better tool (than ROA) for assessing a firm’s (equity) investment merits, because shareholders are most interested in net income as that will either be distributed to them as dividends and/or added to retained earnings, which are “owned” by shareholders. \n\nOnce again, what is management providing the shareholders for their equity investment? Shareholders are interested in earnings, as i",
    "t is earnings, which are either paid out as \n\n145 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\ndividends or retained, and that is what benefits the shareholders. Remember: retained earnings belong to the common shareholders. \n\n**Asset Turnover:** \n\n S ÷ Fixed Assets and S ÷ TA \n\nHere “turnover” is not a physical concept as it was when we spoke about Inventory Turnover. How often do the firm’s _Fixed Assets_ (i.e., Property, Plant, and Equipment),or total assets, “turn over” relative to sales? In other words, how much Sales does a company produce from its fixed or total assets? If two identical firms differ in only this respect, what might the analyst conclude? Does one firm maximize price and revenues? Does one firm manage production and exploit its assets more efficiently, more productively? What do turnover ratios say about pricing, asset utilization, and management performance? \n\nAn analyst may prefer using total assets rather than just fixed assets, in this analysis, if the company being analyzed is a serv",
    "ice company with fewer fixed assets to speak of in comparison with a heavy manufacturing firm. An analyst may use Asset Turnover rather than Return Ratios in the case where EBIT = 0. \n\n If you take shortcuts, you get cut short. -Gary Busey, actor \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 146 \n\n\n## 6.3 The DuPont Model \n\nThe DuPont Model was developed by managers at the DuPont Chemical Corporation for purposes of internally pinpointing strengths and weaknesses within the company’s management hierarchy. Imagine you are at the top of the corporation, that you are the chairman of the board or CEO, and you answer to the company’s shareholders. Arguably, the one ratio you are most interested in would be the company’s return-on-equity ratio. Whether the ROE looks good or bad, you would wish to look further into the performance of the company, make improvements, increase efficiency, and buttress strong areas. \n\nThe DuPont formula provides upper management with a top-down look into the company’s pe",
    "rformance culminating with ROE, which, again, is of the most interest to company shareholders. The CEO looks into three critical areas: \n\n1. Profitability (“Profit Margin” – see below), 2. Operating (“Total Asset Turnover”), and 3. Financial perspec- tives (“Leverage”). \n\n147 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 147 \n\n\nSome Key Points: \n\n1. Good business management produces a favor-     able ROA. \n\n2. Proper leverage may enhance the investor’s     return – ROE. Without Leverage, ROA = ROE. \n\n3. You will notice that the ROA and Leverage     ratios do not match up with our earlier defini- \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 148 \n\n\n tions. \n\n149 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n## 6.4 What Does the Dupont Model Show \n\n## Us? \n\nThe Dupont Model enables us to locate the sources of corporate performance. Imagine you are CEO and have to report performance to shareholders. \n\nFirst, looking top-down, you are interested in ROE. The model shows us the effect of leverage on ROE, given the prior level of ROA. \n\nThen, it ascri",
    "bes operating performance, as defined by ROA, as being attributable to Profit Margin and Total Asset Turnover. This enables executives to locate areas of weakness within the firm and address them. \n\nLet’s illustrate how Leverage benefits an unnamed corporation, given its ROA. \n\nLet’s assume the following: \n\n Debt = $700 Equity = $300 \n\n Total Assets = $1,000 Net Income = $100 \n\nTherefore: \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 150 \n\n 150 \n\n\n ROA = NI / TA = 100 / 1,000 = 0.10 \n\n Leverage = Total Assets / Equity = 1,000 / 300 = 3.34 ROE = ROA x Leverage = (0.10) (3.34) = 0.34 \n\nLeverage has increased the corporation’s ROE! \n\nAlternatively, let’s say the company has no leverage, but the same in Total Assets. In other words, the assets are financed in full by equity only. \n\n ROA = 100 / 1,000 = 0.10 \n\n Leverage = 1,000 / 1,000 = 1.0 ROE = (0.10) (1.0) = 0.10 \n\nWithout any Leverage at all, ROE = ROA. \n\nOf course, Leverage is not something that the company should employ indiscriminately. Too",
    " much debt will raise interest expense to possibly unsustainable levels and thus could have a weakening effect on the TIE ratio, leading eventually to insolvency and bankruptcy – in the worst case. The DuPont Model does not address this risk. \n\nThe Dupont Model is useful for assessment of past performance. It is a poor planning tool. Looking at this example, one may be encouraged to employ more and more risk. Of course, as just noted, too much debt is not necessarily a good thing: it increases the risk of becoming insolvent – causing the TIE Ratio to be below one. \n\n151 Kenneth S.

For example, if a company earned $1 million and has 500,000 shares outstanding, its EPS is $2 per share. \n\nThis, rather than the dollar price, may be used as a measure of “cheapness” or “expensiveness” of a stock. “Value” stocks are generally characterized by low PE ratios. A **Value Stock** may be thought of as such because its price – relative to its earnings – represents a “good buy” for the money, i.e., cheaper. The analyst must be cognizant of the possibility that a low PE may also mean that its future earnings prospects are generally deemed unfavorable. \n\n In contrast, Growth Stocks will reflect (very) high PEs on the basis of",
    " generally optimistic views of future earnings growth. Does this mean that earnings will necessarily catch up with price? Let’s say that a company’s PE = $50/$1 = 50 times earnings. That is a very \n\n157 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 157 \n\n\n Growth Stock \n\nhigh ratio. If the market anticipates next year’s earnings to double, the stock may be said to be trading at just $50/$2 = 25 times next year’s earnings, a more reasonable ratio. \n\nHigh PEs are the effect of the high expectations the market has for future growth in a company’s earnings. As a company’s earnings grow in the future, the multiple that one paid for his shares goes down, making the purchase, with the benefit of hindsight, a good choice. \n\nFor example, if a company earns $1 per share and sells for $50, its PE will equal 50x earnings, quite high, quite “expensive” for what you get. If, however, the earnings next year do indeed grow to say, $5 per share, the buyer at last year’s price who purchased the stock for a meager $50, or only 10",
    "x next year’s earnings, got a good deal. Therefore, companies with high growth expectations will manifest higher PE ratios than the boring companies with low growth prospects. A stock analyst might have said that the PE ratio is now 50x, but only 10x _next year’s_ expected earnings – if s/he so prophesied. \n\nAt the time this is being written, average PE ratios for the S& P 500 Index of (publicly-traded) stocks are approximately “20 times earnings.” Why would someone pay so much for each dollar of earnings? In contrast, privatelyowned stocks, i.e., those not traded on the public-markets, will have much lower PE ratios. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 158 \n\n\n Liquidity Premium \n\n One explanation has to do with the Liquidity Premium associated with publicly traded stocks. “Liquidity” has to do with the ease and speed with which a seller can convert an asset, in this case stock, into cash while obtaining a sales price that represents that asset’s true value, i.e., without reduction i",
    "n price from its true, or “intrinsic” value. \n\nIt is generally very easy to buy and sell a stock. All one needs to do is place an order with a stockbroker (and pay for it within the required three-day settlement period for stock). There is an added or premium value in this liquidity. That is why “Private Equity” investments can be so profitable. A private company will sell at a much lower PE ratio due to the lack of liquidity. If the company is later sold in an IPO (“initial public offering” – the point at which time a stock is sold to the public for the first time), there will be much profit to go around! \n\nThe true cost of buying a privately owned company, i.e., one whose stock or equity is not traded on the public stock exchanges, is not embedded in the price one pays for buying such private corporations. In order to purchase a privately owned company, one has to search for an appropriate one, one that is also available to purchase. This involved time and time is money. The potentia",
    "l buyer is spending time engaged in the search rather than pursuing other profitable opportunities. This is not an issue where publicly traded stock is concerned. These companies are readily available for rapid purchase and sale. \n\nMoreover, in order to buy a private company, one must employ the services of an attorney to negotiate and close \n\n159 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n Cash-oncash Return \n\nthe deal. Bankers must be involved because private stock is usually purchased with large (and often borrowed) sums as opposed to the purchase of a minimum number of shares of stock in a publicly traded stock corporation with few funds. These other costs must be reflected as opportunity costs and thus, under the “Law of One Price” ought to be reflected in the prices of publicly traded stock. Law of One Price requires that similar assets ought to be priced similarly. \n\nThere are certain demerits to the PE Ratio. For instance, Earnings are subject to accrual accounting manipulations. Moreover, companies ",
    "with very low or negative earnings yield a meaningless PE ratio. A company with low earnings may command a ridiculously high PE. A company with negative earnings will not yield a PE at all – it is not computable! \n\n**Dividend Yield = Dper share ÷ Pper share** \n\nOne may view this as the **Cash-on-cash Return** that a stock may provide. If I pay $10 for Yawr Co. stock and it pays an annual dividend of $1, my “cashon-cash return” or dividend yield is 10%. Some industries will reflect higher dividend yields than others. Dividends are usually paid from current net income, but if there are losses, dividends would have to be paid from retained earnings. Typically, mature, rather than growth companies, pay high dividends. This yield ignores price changes. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 160 \n\n\n Total Return \n\n Signal Signaling \n\n It is eminently noteworthy that the dividend yield excludes any capital growth, which is integral to Yawr Co. stock’s Total Return. In other words, the Total Re",
    "turn equals the dividend yield plus the capital gain (or loss) expressed in percentage terms. If you purchased this stock for $10 and sold it at $15, your capital gain would be 50%. The Total Return is: 10% + 50% = 60%. \n\nIt is often considered a positive **Signal** that a company maintains its dividend in the face of losses. This **Signaling** indicates management’s optimism about future earnings prospects. The dividend itself thus boils down to a “human decision” by the firm’s board of directors, rather than a measure of business performance per se. If the board feels that the future is good, it may choose to pay dividends even if the company is presently losing money. \n\n### Dividend Payout Ratio = PR = DTotal ÷ NI = \n\n### DPS ÷ EPS \n\n### This ratio indicates the percentage of net income, \n\n### which is paid out to common shareholders as div\n\n### idends. If a firm earns $1,000,000 and pays \n\n### $100,000 in dividends, its payout ratio is 10%. If \n\n### there is preferred stock, the pr",
    "eferred dividends \n\n161 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n### would first have to be deducted from the net \n\n### income. The PR formula would be adjusted: PR = \n\n### (Common Stock Dividends) ÷ (Net Income – Pre\n\n### ferred Stock Dividends). \n\n### Retention Rate = RR = 1 – PR = (NI – DTotal ) ÷ \n\n### NI = ARE ÷ NI \n\n### This ratio indicates how much of the company’s \n\n### earnings are retained internally for future growth \n\n### and, as such, together with the firm’s ROE impact \n\n### the firm’s growth potential. On the next page, we \n\n### discuss the relationship between earnings retention \n\n### and firm’s growth. (This will be explicated further \n\n### below in the “EFN Model.”) Naturally, PR + RR = \n\n### 1.0 = 100%. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 162 \n\n\n## 7.3 Earnings Retention and Growth \n\nOur working assumption is that the firm has a never-ending appetite for growth. In order to grow its sales, and hopefully its profits thereby, the firm must retain some of its earnings and invest them in p",
    "roductive assets that can be exploited to increase sales in the future. \n\nLet’s examine the following company: \n\nIf the company’s ROE is assumed to be constant, i.e., one of those ceteris paribus assumptions, then the numbers next year will be: \n\nSo, as we see, earnings retention is helpful for growth. Had the company not invested its A.R.E. in productive assets, \n\n163 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 163 \n\n\nits ROE would have declined, as would its prospective growth rate. Companies that have great growth prospects will therefore pay no dividends due to its hunger for using the entirety of its Net Income as Additions to Retained Earnings in order to increase its assets. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 164 \n\n\n## 7.4 The P/BV (Price-to-Book Value) \n\n## and P/E (Price-Earnings) Ratios \n\nThe price of a stock alone does not tell you anything about its value. Take two stocks, one of which is trading at $20 and has 1,000,000 shares outstanding, while the other trades at $10 and has 2,000,000 shares",
    " outstanding. Which one has greater value? They are both the same! \n\nInstead, we will look at relative value, i.e., price relative to either of two measures: Book Value (BV) per share and Earnings per share (EPS). Book Value per share is measured by the accountant’s assessment of the company’s equity (excluding preferred stock, if any) divided by the company’s number of (common) equity shares outstanding (NOSO). We already know how to calculate EPS. \n\nLet’s take the example of two companies that have the same share price, the same number of shares outstanding, but different book values per share (i.e., assets minus liabilities divided by the number of shares outstanding). Which stock is a better “value”? Which is a better investment? \n\nAt the same price, it _seems_ that LCM is a better buy. LCM provides greater BV for each dollar of share price. Clearly, while the market price alone does not necessarily tell you \n\n165 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 165 \n\n\nwhether the stock is a “good buy” or not ",
    "(both stocks here have the same price), there is also some question as to whether Book Value is a reasonable measure. \n\nThe balance sheet perspective (i.e., “accounting book value,” or the company’s net assets) depicted above is fraught with the many interpretive accrual accounting problems enumerated earlier (specifically, we enumerated four issues). There is likely more historical bias embedded in book value than in earnings. On the other hand, Price-to-Book (P/BV) tends to be a more stable measure than the PE ratio. Further, P/ BV ignores how well management utilizes the assets in producing earnings for shareholders. Earnings certainly matter! Earnings are what most shareholders focus on. \n\n Summary: Price-to-Book Value \n\n Pro \n\n- More stable than PE **Con** \n\n- Subject to accrual accounting idiosyncrasies \n\n- Most shareholders focus on earnings \n\n- Ignores management effectiveness \n\n ◦ Asset utilization \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 166 \n\n\n ◦ Earnings production \n\nAnother w",
    "ay of making the assessment of whether the stock price is “fair” or not, would be by looking at the stock’s P/E ratio, i.e., Price (per share) ÷ Earnings (per share). How much does the prospective (or current) shareholder pay for a share of the stock in order for him to “earn” so much in terms of EPS? Remember that the shareholder is most interested in earnings per share because that is the source of his dividends and retained earnings, a portion of which he owns. In contrast to the first approach, this approach is income statement oriented. **You should be able to calculate EPS and PE independently.** \n\nEPS are $1 and $0.10 per share for LCM and TC respectively. Clearly, however, LCM is “cheaper,” with a PE ratio of 100x earnings, whereas TC reflects a ratio of 1,000x its earnings – if you accept PE as a valid valuation/pricing measure. (The PE ratios presented in this example are much higher than will be typically found in the markets \n\n- even in good times.) \n\n167 Kenneth S. Bigel \n",
    "\n\nWhen an investor purchases a stock, s/he is making an investment in the company’s ability to generate profits. (This is not to say that the assets have no value.) The profits, in turn will be either distributed to the shareholder as a (cash) dividend – or retained by the corporation and then reinvested in additional assets that should produce even more profits going forward. \n\nWe have already cited the basic problems in utilizing (legitimate) accounting data in the course of financial analysis. Was “book value” useful in this example? In recent years, management and its accountants have been very “creative” in the presentation of accounting summaries. Is EPS reliable accounting-wise? The analyst has to be cognizant of alternative accounting presentations – both legitimate and not. \n\nNote regarding EPS calculation: \n\nThe calculation for EPS presented above (i.e., net income ÷ the number of shares outstanding) is simplistic and should be used only when better data are not available. \n\n",
    "In fact, the accountant will present both “Basic” and “Diluted” EPS, the calculations for which are quite involved. The student analyst must choose whether to utilize the Basic EPS datum in calculating the PE ratio or the Diluted version. \n\nThe Diluted datum assumes that convertible and other “complex” securities have been converted to stock; this results in a lower EPS number. The theoretical supposition inherent in the Diluted earnings figure may make it inap\n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 168 \n\n\npropriate for use in PE valuation in the eyes of some analysts. \n\n169 Kenneth S.

Similarly, no single ratio alone can provide an integrative view of the firm. Analysis requires a cross-sectional approach. \n\n Cross-sectional analysis will require combining ratios often across different industry categories in order to get a clearer picture of the goings-on of the firm. \n\n181 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n## 7.11 Some Limitations of Financial \n\n## Ratios \n\nAs we have learned, most financial ratios consist of accounting data, which are limited in interpretive usefulness, but may be all we have. The astute analyst is aware of this and makes appropriate adjustments. The principle of _Garbage-in, Garbage-out_ always pertains. Ratios are useless if the accounting data inputted are suspect. Here are some issues to look out for. \n\n1. _Accrual Accounting_ data management: Garbage-     in, Garbage-out. \n\n2. Compa",
    "nies engage in _Real Earnings_ “window-     dressing” in order to make their statements     appear in a certain manner; examples include     pulling forward or deferring actual expenses. \n\n3. Accounting policies differ from one firm to     another, making cross-sectional analysis diffi-     cult; for example, one company uses FIFO     while another uses LIFO. \n\n4. Ratios are “static” and do not necessarily reveal     future relationships. \n\n5. A ratio can hide problems lying underneath; an     example would be a high Quick Ratio hiding a     lot of bad accounts receivable. \n\n6. Liabilities are not always disclosed; an example     would be _contingent_ liabilities due to lawsuit. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 182 \n\n 182 \n\n\n Since it may – or may not – happen, the accountant will not disclose it. There has been no transaction. (This may appear in the footnotes only.) \n\n7. Companies are often in multiple lines of busi-     ness. Therefore, identifying an industry group is     virt",
    "ually impossible, making cross-sectional     analysis ineffective. \n\n8. Industry benchmarks (see prior page) are often     only approximations, and inaccurate ones at     that. Also, there are often data entry errors. \n\n183 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n## 7.12 Chapters 5 7: Review Questions \n\n1.

The financial analyst gathers information from numerous sources. Where he gets his/her information will depend large",
    "ly on who s/he is. There are two possibilities: \n\nThe **internal** corporate analyst, i.e., the analyst who works for and “inside” the corporation, will collect information from the various company departments including marketing, purchasing, administration, economics, and others, each of which will “sign off” on the data that s/he includes in his/her financial projections. This analyst is charged with compiling the data meaningfully and projecting the relative profitability and hence worthiness of alternative, and sometimes competing, possible investment projects. The purpose is to engage incorporate Financial Planning. \n\nFor example, the sales projections may come from the mar\n\n189 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 189 \n\n\nketing department. This department may provide unit sales and pricing data, which the analyst compiles and includes in his/her projections. The analyst may ask that the department “sign off” on this portion of the overall projections and thereby take some responsibility for the d",
    "ata. Alternatively, the analyst may investigate the reasonableness of the data and provide alternative projections. \n\nThe **external** (securities) analyst, i.e., one who is not employed by the subject corporation, but perhaps who works instead for a financial institution that has some investment or equity interest in the corporation, will not have access to the same valuable information and data that the internal corporate analyst will have. The methods s/he uses will differ accordingly. The external analyst does not have access to the data regarding corporate investment projects adopted and which are now just coming on-line, or recently came online. S/he therefore will use public financial statements in order to derive inferences about the corporation’s growth prospects and future share price. \n\nWhen we, individuals, think of “investing,” many of us think of investing in stocks and bonds. This is not typically what companies invest in. What _do_ (non-financial) corporations “invest” ",
    "in? \n\nLet us remember that, here, we are all financial analysts and hence we take on a “corporate perspective.” In this sense, _corporate_ investment refers to things that (nonfinancial) corporations invest in, in order to _maintain_ and _grow_ their businesses. Such investments include, but are not limited to, the following: \n\n- Property, plant, and equipment – P, P, & E \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 190 \n\n\n- Inventory \n\n- Research & Development (R&D) – we will not     deal with R&D in our forthcoming discussions. \n\nSome very useful definitions: \n\n- Expense: a reduction (debit) to revenues,     reported on the Income Statement. Some     expenses involve the movement of cash, e.g.,     wages; others do not, e.g., depreciation. \n\n- Expenditure: involves the movement of cash –     an outlay or outflow of funds, which may either     be expensed and/or capitalized. If “capitalized,”     it will be expensed as depreciation over future     years. P, P, & E fit this category. Remember",
    ",     land (“property”) is not depreciable even though     it is capitalized. In contrast, (cash-) dividends     are expenditures that involve cash outlays; divi-     dends are not expensed because they are returns     to the owners. \n\nBelow you will find some examples of expenses and expenditures. \n\n Expense Expen \n\n Wages Yes Yes \n\n Depreciation Yes No \n\n Property No Yes \n\n191 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n## 8.3 Pro-Forma (Projected) Cash Flow \n\n## Analysis \n\nEstimating future cash flows: Whether s/he is internal or external, the analyst is involved in projecting future (accounting) profits and often, more importantly, projected net cash flows. In order to gather these data, the internal analyst must involve different departments, thereby playing corporate “politics” in order to complete the job. \n\nFor each of the following, indicate from which department the projections may come (e.g., economics, marketing, purchasing, etc.). \n\nUnit Sales \n\nFirst, the internal analyst may receive unit sales ",
    "projections from the marketing department. \n\nThe analyst must also be aware of the issue of _Cannibalization_ – the detrimental effect on other sales of the introduction of the new project (see section #8.4). For example, if Microsoft projects sales of two million units of Windows Vista, of which one million would have otherwise gone to Windows XP sales, the analyst would recognize on his spreadsheet only the one-million-unit increment. This is because the decision to introduce a new product came, in a sense, at the expense of the old product’s sales. Analysts are interested only in what the new product con\n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 192 \n\n 192 \n\n\ntributes incrementally – above and beyond present matters. \n\n### Sales Prices \n\nIn order to project future revenues, the analyst will thus possibly need to obtain both unit sales data (i.e., expected quantities sold) and “pricing” information (i.e., expected price per unit). \n\nOperating Costs \n\nThis information may be derived from m",
    "any different parties, e.g., purchasing, operations, etc. Operating costs may include: \n\n- Cost of Goods Sold: This refers to inventory     costs as explained earlier. \n\n- Selling, general, and administrative costs: These     costs refer to non-production expenditures,     including salaries and wages, rent, advertising,     and travel. \n\n- Taxes: Although taxes are not an operating cost     per se, we all know what Ben Franklin said     about “death and taxes.” Since taxes cannot be     avoided, they should be deducted in the analy-     sis. \n\nNon-operating and Capital Costs \n\nIn “spreading the numbers,” the internal analyst will pay attention only to projected _operating_ data, and not to any capital or other non-operating data / costs. S/he is inter\n\n193 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n Key Terms: \n\n Cost of Capital \n\nested usually only in what the potential project will produce as a business enterprise alone. Capital costs include the cost of paying interest on debt, and the dividend and “grow",
    "th” costs of equity. \n\n### As a heads-up, the cost of capital is \n\n### an issue with which we shall deal \n\n### later in great depth. Once the ana\n\n### lyst has arrived at the yearly operat\n\n### ing numbers, usually projected cash \n\n### flow (rather than accounting prof\n\n### its), the cost of capital will then be \n\n### brought in as the “discount rate,” \n\n### rather than as a dollar figure. This is \n\n### the rate at which the future cash \n\n### flows will be “discounted,” or \n\n### translated, to present values, thereby enabling a \n\n### level playing field, in terms of time. In other \n\n### words, by discounting, we are able to equate the \n\n### value of a dollar paid tomorrow with a dollar \n\n### today. This way, an investment decision may be \n\n### made based on profitability and possibly other \n\n### measures. \n\n Note: \n\n As we continue through these readings, pay careful attention to the words “expense” and “expenditure.” They are not the same. “Expense” is an accounting phrase reflected o",
    "n the Income Statement; expense is a reduction to Net \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 194 \n\n\n Income – it may or may not involve cash. “Expenditure” refers to the deployment of funds – it will involve cash but may or may not be expensed. Expenditures may be capitalized or expensed. \n\n195 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n Key Terms: \n\n Incremental Incrementalism \n\n## 8.4 Incrementalism \n\nThe analyst’s “end-game” is to produce a spreadsheet reflecting future years’ respective, **incremental** , or additional, cash flows and/or profits, and possibly other things as well. In general, the principle of **incrementalism** pertains. It is only incremental cash flows, i.e., those which are added due to the project’s implementation, which are relevant to decision-making. If the company brought in $100 and now – with the new project – it brings in $125, the increment is $25. Incremental revenues – and costs – did not exist before the project was effected. Therefore, _sunk costs_ and the _cannibalized_ p",
    "ortions of projections’ data are excluded as will be discussed immediately below. It is the incremental data which drive the decision to invest or not. We will learn this better by example. \n\nBy contrast, the accountant reports all historical economic events. Later, we will conduct a basic exercise in producing a pro-forma statement, i.e., a projected, income statement. Below are the two types of incrementalism: \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 196 \n\n 196 \n\n\n Sunk Costs \n\n Cannibalization \n\n**Sunk Costs** – these are expenditures which have already been outlaid and should not be therefore “doublecounted.” For example, suppose a factory has unused, or under-used, equipment, which may be exploited, for a proposed project. The cost of the equipment having already been spent or “sunk,” should not be considered again; the cost is not relevant to deciding, for example, whether or not an existing asset should be exploited in a new way. The project merely proposes to exploit unused, or un",
    "der-utilized, assets – or “sunk costs” – in order to increase sales and profits. \n\n**Cannibalization** – When a new product is introduced, some of the revenue may have been _cannibalized_ from the potential sales of the old product. For example, if the new product is expected to sell 1.5 million units, and the old product had sold 1.0 million, we are interested only in the 0.5 mm increment. That is what the investment decision depends upon. Hence the phrase “cannibalization.” A change in pricing would complicate this analysis, i.e., how much of the revenue increase is due to volume and how much is due to a price increase? \n\n197 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n## 8.5 Corporate Forecasting and Strategic \n\n## Planning \n\nA financial analyst will collect reliable financial data from internal numerous sources, if possible, which s/he will cite in his/her forecast, list the assumptions as part of the report, and “spread the numbers” accordingly.

    "ng is an exercise in creating a pro forma (accounting-based) income statement. Later, we will see some analytic techniques, which may be implemented to convert “profits” to “cash flow,” if the latter is deemed more desirable. A “strategic plan” involves forecasting financial data for multiple future years. \n\nPro forma Financial Statements \n\nComplete the pro forma I/S based on the following _assumptions_ : \n\n1.

At that time, a mortgage will be in     place. The new building will cost $11,000 and     will have a twenty-year life. It will be depreci-     ated on a straight-line basis; a salvage value of     $1,000 is assumed. \n\n199 Kenneth S.

Do this for each year until you get to Five versus (or “over”) Four. \n\n201 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 201 \n\n\nUse four decimal places throughout. What do you find and why? \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 202 \n\n\n## 8.7 The Tax Effect of Depreciation \n\n**Depreciation** is a non-cash expense (and NOT an “expenditure”), which serves to recognize the consumption of fixed assets over time, e.g., plant and equipment, but NOT property. \n\nThe “consumption,” or use, of long-term, fixed assets is reflected as a separate operating, depreciation expense. Although depreciation is a non-cash expense, it provides the corporation with cash because it reduces taxable income and hence the tax liability. \n\nWhen depreciation can be “imputed” to the manufacturing process, its charges are included in the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS). For example, if the",
    " manufacturer of a $1 million piece of equipment warrants that the machine will be used up after manufacturing 1 million units, the accountant may impute (i.e., include) $1 per unit of production to COGS. This could confuse the statements reader. Below, we will _not_ assume such “imputation.” \n\nIllustration of Depreciation Tax Shield (Ignoring Interest Expense): \n\n203 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 203 \n\n\nDue to depreciation, a non-cash expense, net income will be lower by only $12 rather than the full $20 of depreciation expensed; the $8 difference represents the tax savings, and hence the “tax shield,” due to the deduction of the depreciation expense. \n\n Tax Shield = (D) (T) = ($20) (0.40) = $8 \n\nThe “tax shield” of depreciation, i.e., D (T), is a very real phenomenon in that it actually reduces the tax burden, which is viewed as a provision of cash, albeit depreciation alone provides no cash. The acquisition of a depreciable asset, e.g., a building or equipment, creates a _tax shield_ or benef",
    "it that provides more cash flow than before the acquisition. \n\nYou may think of “EBITDA” (i.e., earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) as EBIT plus depreciation (and amortization). \n\n### On Humility, Honor, and Accomplishment \n\n A life spent making mistakes is not only more honor\n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 204 \n\n\n able, but more useful than a life spent doing nothing. -George Bernard Shaw \n\n That’s why pencils have erasers. \n\n -Norman Isaac Bigel \n\n (1917 – 2017) \n\n205 Kenneth S.

Bigel \n\n 207 \n\n\n## 9.2 Free Cash Flow \n\nWhy _Cash Flow_? A corporation’s value is dependent, in large part, on the income and cash flow it produces. Cash flow is different from income in that “income” is based on “accrual accounting,” which will reflect certain noncash events such as depreciation, and many other “distortions,” some of which were discussed earlier. One key distortion had to do with “timing” – the accountant may book a sale, for example when “constructively received,” i.e., when legally and economically receivable, but not yet received in actual cash. \n\nUnder accrual accounting, the accountant records economic transactions rather than the movement of actual cash received and paid out. (In theory, i",
    "n the long run such accounting vs. cash differences even out.) Because of these differences, financial analysts, who are more cash-oriented, must make certain adjustments to the accounting data in their own calculations and projections. \n\nIn a certain sense, cash flow is more important to corporate valuation than income because dividends are paid out to investors in cash. Further, when engaging in corporate planning, a possible capital investment will be judged attractive dependent upon the cash flow it produces in the future because it is cash that, arguably, fuels growth. \n\nWhat is _Free Cash Flow_? Capital investments, i.e., “growth” investments, include expenditures for hard assets, as well as for product development, and much more. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 208 \n\n 208 \n\n\n“Free cash flow” is funds that an investment project or the corporation as a whole generates beyond its own internal and ongoing needs. We may think of free cash flow as the cash, which is left over fr",
    "om an investment project, after all net operating funds generated by the project are utilized for necessary, non-discretionary purposes, including hard assets’ maintenance and replacement, and increases in working capital; this “left-over” amount may be used for other financial purposes – growth or expansion, at the discretion of management. \n\nWorking capital must often be increased. The project, or corporation, first generates operating cash flows, some of which are needed to replace or maintain assets, to invest in inventory and receivables, and to maintain the firm’s competitive position. \n\nSo, think of “free” cash flow (FCF) as _discretionary_ , think of it as “ _Discretionary Cash Flow_ .” _Necessary_ capital and other non-discretionary expenditures are required in order to maintain the business as is. A leaky roof must be repaired; there is no choice. A worn-out gasket must be replaced. \n\nAnalogously, you may recall the parallel notion of “disposable income” in Macroeconomics. (A",
    "fter deducting taxes, and necessities, such as food and rent, from gross income, the consumer has some funds left over for discretionary purposes, which might include investment, or buying that deluxe Apple Watch s/he has coveted for so long.) Similarly, “free cash flow” is the net, operating after-tax cash that the firm may generate from investment in a new building or equipment (i.e., the investment “project”) after considering necessary operating and capital expenditures, including maintenance and replacement, but excluding \n\n209 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n expansionary, or growth-oriented, capital expenditures as this would be discretionary. \n\n The more FCF the firm generates, the greater the firm’s ability to invest in new assets, to use the funds to pay down debt or to pay dividends, and still other discretionary possibilities. \n\n The Mathematics \n\n One formula for use in this process is presented below. We start with operating earnings, which, in this case, is defined as “EBIT” or, alt",
    "ernatively “EBITDA 1 ,”i.e., earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization 2 \n\n. To the finan- cial analyst, the projected income or cash flow statement may look something like the following: \n\n Thus the analyst would calculate Free Cash Flow (FCF) to equal: \n\n [(EBITDA) (1 – T)] + [(Depreciation) (T)] – [Neces\n\n1. In some instances, an analyst may choose to use “EBITDA,” i.e., EBIT with     depreciation and amortization added back. The use of this figure will     depend on the data presentation and analyst choice. \n\n2. As we will learn later in this text, amortization has to do with the reduction in     the value of an intangible asset over time; in this sense it is like deprecia-     tion. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 210 \n\n\n sary Capital Expenditures] – [Increase in Net Working Capital] \n\n The elements of the formula \n\n The formula consists of four different parts. Let’s look at each of them. \n\n1. EBITDA (1 – T) \n\n2. Add: Depreciation (Tax Rate) = (D) × (T) \n\n3. Less: N",
    "ecessary Capital Expenditures     3 \n\n4. Less: Increases in Net Working Capital \n\n5. Equals: Free Cash Flow (FCF) \n\n Note that “T” (in “1-T” and in “D x T”) stands for the firm’s tax bracket, or percent, whereas EBITDA is in dollars, including the “T” there. While at this stage of the corporate planning and investment analysis process, the firm has not yet decided whether it will choose the investment or not and, if so, how it will be financed, and therefore does not know its projected interest payments, it does know its tax bracket, which is based on the firm’s meeting a specified lower threshold (“bracket”) of earnings. \n\n1. EBITDA: \n\n Take note of the use of EBITDA rather than EBT in the formula. There are several details here, which bear explanation; we will take them one at a time. First, account\n\n3. Note that “Capital Expenditures” here refers only to _required_ expenditures,     i.e., maintenance and replacement expenditures, and not _discretionary_     expenditures, which may b",
    "e used for expansion and growth. By subtracting     out necessary (i.e., non-discretionary) CE, we are left with Free CF. \n\n 211 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\ning EBT would include interest expense – as a deduction from EBIT. “Interest expense” is the result of a prior capital financing decision and, as such, should be independent of this analysis, which focuses on the cash-based, operating earnings a firm or a project produces (EBITDA), and not on financial decisions. In our analysis and projections, we should thus exclude interest, which is a discretionary capital structure, solvency-oriented matter for decision. \n\nAccordingly, the “EBITDA (1 – T)” adjustment eliminates the interaction of interest and its effect on tax. To see how this adjustment works, let us compare the results of the formula with the following alternate spreadsheet presentation. Let’s say that the firm produces $100,000 of EBITDA, has interest expense of $20,000, and pays taxes at a 30% rate. By formula we would project EBI",
    "TDA (1 – T) = $100,000 (1 – .30) = **$70,000**. (For this example, we shall assume, for the moment, that depreciation and amortization are zero.) This is the figure we want, which represents earnings after taxes, in the absence of interest. The “1 \n\n- T” multiplier shows what is left after paying taxes. This project produces, or is expected to produce, $70,000 in operating cash flow (next year). \n\nIn the following spreadsheet, we would show the same $70,000 result, only by different presentation (in order to prove out the formula) – under the alternate FCF analysis. We also show, side by side, the accounting income reported, which does not suit the purpose of the analysis because it includes interest expense, which is a financial – not an operating – event or cash (out) flow. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 212 \n\n\n2. The Depreciation Tax Shield: \n\nDepreciation is a non-cash expense (as is amortization, which we have been assuming herein to be zero), which is deducted _from_ opera",
    "ting earnings _before_ income taxes. Therefore, we add back just the tax savings that depreciation provides but ignore depreciation itself. It is assumed that the (internal) analyst knows the firm’s tax bracket. Depreciation is tax deductible and, as such provides cash, but otherwise itself directly provides no cash. You found above an in-depth illustration of the “tax effect of depreciation,” absent other media. You may wish to view that page again now. \n\n Note: \n\n EBITDA (1-T) + D (T) = EBIT (1-T) + D. (To prove this out, substitute in the equation the following values: EBIT = $100; D = $20; A = $0; and T = .30) The two phrases are mathematically equivalent but appear to have somewhat different connotations. In the latter case, EBIT appears to refer to accounting income, hence our preference for EBITDA, a more cash-oriented notion. In the latter for\n\n213 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n mulation, adding back depreciation, which is a non-cash expense, intuitively appears to contradict the aforesa",
    "id idea that depreciation does not provide cash flow, even though it does work out mathematically and conceptually. \n\n3. Capital Expenditures: \n\nThere are the three categories of capital expenditures (“Cap Ex”), which we shall need to incorporate in the free cash flow projection. They are: \n\n1. Maintenance 2. Replacement \n\n3. Expansion \n\nOccasionally, the walls must be painted and the premises properly maintained. Roofs may blow off, and machinery gaskets may “blow,” requiring replacement. Expansionary investments may involve acquiring additional factory space or equipment, in order to increase production, and hence sales and profits. \n\nMaintenance and replacement expenditures are clearly _necessary_ ; expansionary expenditures are _discretionary_ and are (generally) undertaken in order to provide growth, i.e., increased sales and profits. We would deduct necessary capital expenditures in order to arrive at free cash flow. \n\nAccounting rules do not require separating out necessary from",
    " discretionary capital expenditures; any breakdown, if provided, may be found in the footnotes. This information will assist the analyst in gauging the firm’s growth prospects. Absent this breakdown, the most common prac\n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 214 \n\n\ntice among analysts is to use _all_ capital expenditures in the formula, although this is a matter of analyst judgment. \n\n4. Net Working Capital: \n\n“Net working capital” may be defined as current assets less current liabilities (NWC = CA – CL). Any increase in current assets, or in net current assets (i.e., “NWC”), _uses_ financial resources and thus _reduces_ cash or cash flow. For example, an increase in inventory uses funds. \n\nSimilarly, an increase in current liabilities _provides_ funds, and may be thought of as a “source” of funds. A decrease in current liabilities uses funds. For example, when a company pays its accounts payable, it uses funds. \n\nIf a firm is to grow it will have to increase its Net Working Capital. \n\n",
    "The table below summarizes the possibilities and instructs you how to insert the changes into the FCF formula. Some add to FCF; others are subtracted from FCF. \n\nNote that, in calculating Free Cash Flow and the relevant prospective changes in Current Assets, we ignore expected changes in the cash account, focusing instead on changes in the cash flow affecting the cash account. To include changes in the cash account itself in calculating FCF, would be “double-counting.” \n\n215 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\nWhat can the corporation do with its FCF? \n\n- Purchase more P, P, & E. \n\n- Expand inventory. \n\n- Invest in Mergers and Acquisitions (using shares     when high-priced). \n\n- Increase R & D. \n\n- Pay off Debt. \n\n- Pay discretionary (common stock) dividends. \n\n- Buy back common shares (when cheap). \n\nA potential corporate investment project that throws off a lot of FCF is desirable. A firm, as a whole, that throws off lots of FCF may be thought of in a most positive light – as one, among other possi",
    "bilities, that has a lot of growth potential and makes for a good investment. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 216 \n\n\n## 9.3 Free Cash Flow Exercises \n\n### Free Cash Flow: Exercise #1 \n\nThat covers the formula. Let us work up a quick, all inclusive, example. You are given the following: solve for “free cash flow.” Assume that there is no amortization. \n\n [(EBITDA) (1 – T)] + [(Depreciation) (T)] – [Necessary Capital Expenditures] – [Increase in Net Working Capital] \n\n### FCF (Formulation) = $100 (1 – .30) + $1 (.30) – \n\n### $7 – $2 \n\n (Calculation) = $70 + $0.30 – $7 – $2 = $61.3 million \n\nWorking Capital next year versus this year increased by $2 million: (6-2) – (5-3). Alternatively, one might say that current assets increased by $1 million, a useof funds; current liabilities decreased by $1 million, also a use of funds. \n\n217 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 217 \n\n\nThe net use of funds was therefore $2 million, which accordingly reduces free cash flow. \n\nTo summarize, _free cash flow_ may b",
    "e thought of as the firm’s after-tax cash flows less any spending on either the maintenance or replacement of fixed assets, and in acquiring working capital. The free cash flow left over may be used either to pay down debt, pay dividends, buy back stock, for discretionary growth investments and more. The firm will (should) choose investments that further maximize FCF. \n\nThis discussion has, so far, assumed that we, financial analysts, are _perfectly_ capable of making accurate, numerical projections about matters that have not yet occurred. In reality, projections are virtually always going to be somewhat incorrect – when all is said and done. Projections “under uncertainty” are beyond this manual’s scope. \n\nThis example is generic in the sense that it may represent either the view of an external analyst looking at a corporation’s most recent financial report, and, based on the report, making an assessment of the corporation’s growth prospects and equity investment merits based on its ",
    "FCF; or it could be a projection that an internal analyst makes for a potential corporate investment project. \n\n### Projecting Free Cash Flow: Exercise #2 \n\nWe have already projected net income and earnings per share (see above under the heading “Corporate Forecasting and Strategic Planning”). We also understand the implica\n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 218 \n\n\ntions of depreciation, a non-cash expense, on income and cash. \n\nNow, we will conduct an exercise, based on the earlier net income and EPS projections, in which we shall create a pro-forma statement – of a sort – of _free cash flows_ for multiple future years rather than just one year’s net income. The figures for EBIT and Depreciation were calculated and the solutions can be found in Section #8.6; these figures are needed for the FCF problem herewith. This spreadsheet will be useful when, later, we assess such cash flows in _present value_ terms in order to make capital investment decisions. In this connection, take note ",
    "that interest, for example, is excluded from FCF because it is a _capital_ cost, \n\n### as discussed earlier. In order to do this, we need to \n\n### recall the FCF formula. Here, once again, it is: \n\n [(EBITDA) (1 – T)] + [(Depreciation) (T)] – [Necessary Capital Expenditures] – [Increase in Net Working Capital] \n\nIn our pro-forma, Five-year income statement, we have many of the elements: EBIT, depreciation, and tax rate (i.e., 40%). Let us assume the following for the missing parts: \n\n1. For EBIT and Depreciation figures, use the data     calculated earlier – in Section #8.6. \n\n2. There is no amortization. \n\n3. Replacement and maintenance capital expendi-     tures shall be $1,000 in “Year 1” and grow     thereafter at a 5% rate. \n\n4. Current Assets will increase in Year 1 by $500     the first year, and each year thereafter at a \n\n219 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n growth rate of 10%. \n\n5. Current Liabilities will increase in Year 1 by     $750 and each year thereafter at a growth rate of     5%",
    ". \n\n ◦ (Hint: an increase in current liabilities is a source of funds.) ◦ Take note that the differences are incremental. \n\nTo make matters simple, a spreadsheet is provided below, which is consistent with the FCF formula. Notice the (horizontal) line breaks, which assist you in separating out the pieces of the formula from their respective sub-parts. Note also that cash outflows should be bracketed, since they are negative. Some of the information in the spreadsheet will be imported from the earlier net income exercise, while some will be derived from the set of four assumptions noted on the prior page. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 220 \n\n\n Until the day when G-d shall deign to reveal the future to man, all human wisdom is summed up in these two words, ‘Wait and hope.’ -Alexandre Dumas The Count of Monte Cristo \n\n221 Kenneth S.

Bigel \n\n\n Key Terms: \n\n Internal Funds \n\n## 9.4 External Funds Needed \n\n## Formula (EFN) \n\nA company needs additional “capital” (i.e., financial resources) in order to grow and to maintain its existing plant and equipment, and to acquire additional inventory. It cannot achieve a sales increase (“growth”) without adding on productive “capital assets” (not to mention maintaining existing assets) in order to produce more goods for sale. \n\nSome further **internal funds** will be generated by accounts payable, also in the normal course of business conduct. Payables are, essentially, free, short-term loans provided by the firm’s suppliers for, usually, 30 days. Payables are, financially speaking, (interest-) free sources of funds. We call these funds, including payables and retained earnings, by numerous names: “spontaneous, automatic,” or “internal.” Some of the company’s capital needs will be met “spo",
    "ntaneously,” in the normal course of doing business by retaining some, or all, of its earnings. Such funds may be thought of as having been generated “internally.” \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 224 \n\n 224 \n\n\n External Funds \n\nFor the balance of its capital requirements, the corporation will need to go “outside” the firm’s normal venues – to bank lenders, and/or to bond and stock investors for its **EFN** or **external** requirements. The extent to which the company will use either _debt_ or _equity,_ and in what proportions, is the subject of the “Capital Structure” topic; this topic will be discussed later. The EFN projection is an essential component to of the corporation’s capital planning. \n\nThe EFN Formula: The formula, which we shall develop, consists of three parts. The first part tells us how much additional assets the firm will require in order to support a stated sales growth objective. This part is based on the firm’s required ratio of assets to sales. It will need m",
    "ore assets in order to produce more sales. We shall refer to this amount as the “gross requirement,” for lack of a better phrase. \n\nThe next two parts indicate the extent to which first, accounts payable, and second, retained earnings may reduce the gross requirement. After having reduced the gross requirement by the two internally generated or spontaneous sources of funds, we are left with a figure, which tells us how much additional, external financing the firm will have to arrange for itself in order to achieve its preset sales growth objective. External financing will take the form of new debt and/or equity. \n\nEFN Model’s Restrictive Assumption: \n\nWe shall assume that Financial Ratios remain the \n\n225 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n Static Ratios \n\nsame over time, i.e., we will conduct “static analysis.” In practice, projections may not conform to past relationships precisely, for reasons known to, or assumed by, the analyst. Here, for simplicity, we shall dispense with this complication. \n\nI",
    "n order to focus on the nature of the EFN formula – and not on dynamic financial ratio matters – we will assume, in the exercise to come, **static ratios**. “Static” means unchanging in time. \n\n### The EFN Formula – The Math \n\n**Terminology:** \n\nFunds – this refers to any and all financial resources that the firm may call upon, including cash, various forms of debt or borrowings, and equity, the latter two of which, like cash, also enable the firm to invest in any proposed corporate investment project. \n\nInternal Funds– these may also be referred to as either “spontaneous” or “automatic.” These funds are automatically or spontaneously generated in the normal course of doing business. An example of this is accounts payable. When a producer orders raw materials, a free loan for usually thirty days is created by the supplier. Over the course of the year, and as the thirty days continually “roll over” over the course of the entire year, the producing firm is supplied with a free source of ",
    "“internal” funds. The company will also internally generate funds as it earns and retains a portion of its earnings – “retained earnings.” \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 226 \n\n\nExternal Funds – This refers to any “additional” funds the firm may need to raise beyond any funds that are generated in the normal course of doing business in order to finance a proposed corporate investment project. For external funds the firm will have to go, so to speak, outside the confines of its ordinary business by calling upon bank lenders, debt and equity investors, and possibly others. External funds are required to the extent that internal funds are insufficient. \n\n**The EFN Formula:** \n\n EFN = [(A 0 /S 0 ) ΔS] – [(AP 0 /S 0 ) ΔS] – [(M 0 ) (S 1 ) (RR 0 )] \n\n OR \n\n [(A 0 ) (S 1 /S 0 –1)] – [(AP 0 ) (S 1 /S 0 – 1)] – [(M 0 )(S 1 ) (RR 0 )] \n\n**EFN** = Required increase in assets [(A 0 /S 0 ) ΔS] \n\nLess:“spontaneous” increase in Liabilities [(AP 0 /S 0 ) ΔS] \n\nLess:“spontaneous” increase in Reta",

If it has enough cash, it will incur        an opportunity costs, because the cash        would not be invested. If it had to bor-        row the money, it would incur an        explicit borrowing cost at a rate of        interest. However, most firms are pro-        vided with 30-day terms of sale        from its suppliers, which amounts to a        30-day free loan, during which time it        incurs neither an opportunity– nor an        explicit",
    "–cost. In this sense, credit        terms – Accounts Payable – provide        cash flow to the buying firm. The cor-        poration receives a free loan, of a sort,        from its suppliers.     ◦ Although the Accounts Payable will \n\n229 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 229 \n\n\n be paid in 30-days, the firm will have on average over the course of the year, 30-days of access to a free source of funds. The firm, more or less simultaneously, pays down the Payables and then re-orders more goods. \n\n- Additions to Retained Earnings     ◦ This, clearly, provides a stream of        internal funds to the corpora-        tion as profits are made and retained. \n\nWe also said that, to the extent that internal funding is insufficient to satisfy all the investment needs, it may seek additional funding externally. \n\nExternal Funds: \n\n- Short-term bank lines of credit \n\n- Short-term bank loans – “notes” \n\n- Long-term (bank) loans – “debt” \n\n- Issuance (sale) of corporate notes or bonds \n\n- Issuance (sale) of equi",
    "ty \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 230 \n\n\n## 9.6 The EFN Formula Explained \n\n### The EFN Formula Explained \n\nYou will observe that the EFN formula has three parts (separated by two minus signs). \n\n EFN = [(A 0 /S 0 ) ΔS)] – [(AP 0 /S 0 ) ΔS] – [(M 0 ) (S 1 ) (RR 0 )] \n\nThe first part represents the required increase in total assets [(A 0 /S 0 ) ΔS)] needed to sustain the projected sales increase. Last year, assets equal to A 0 were required by the firm to sustain a sales level equal to S 0 .Hence, we formulate the ratio A 0 /S 0. Assuming this ratio remains static, next year, the firm will require so much more in assets; this is arrived at by multiplying the ratio by ΔS, the projected sales increase; ΔS = S 1 – S 0. \n\nHowever, some of this “gross requirement” will be “spontaneously” or “automatically” met by the normal business generation of “internal” funds in the manner of spontaneous liabilities, by which we primarily refer to accounts payable (not notes payable or the current",
    " portion of longterm debt payable). Last year, such internal funds represented a certain percentage of sales: (A 0 /S 0 ). If we multiply this dollar figure by the projected sales increase (ΔS), we may see to what extent spontaneous liabilities reduce the original “gross requirement.” \n\nFinally, the firm will also – hopefully – generate and retain \n\n231 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 231 \n\n\nsome of its earnings, thereby further reducing its “gross requirement.” If we take the firm’s net profit margin (NI/S = M 0 ) and multiply it by next year’s sales (S 1 ), we get next year’s projected net profits: (M 0 ) (S 1 ) = NI 1. If we the net profit margin (i.e., M 0 = NI/S) times next year’s sales, we get next year’s net profits. If we further multiply this by the firm’s retention rate (RR 0 ), we get the firm’s projected retained earnings. \n\nAfter all is said and done, we have a figure – the dollar amount of EFN – that enables the firm to plan for next year’s acquisition of external financing, and henc",
    "e increased asset levels in support of the planned sales increase. Interestingly, this formula does not instruct us relative to the extent to which the external requirement should be met by either debt or equity, and in what Debtto-Equity proportion. \n\n Note: \n\n For simplicity of presentation only, below we will ignore the “rule” of using an average balance sheet datum when concocting mixed ratios (i.e., those that include both balance sheet and income statement data). This simplification is in addition to the static analysis already assumed. \n\nSome useful formulae: \n\n- ΔS = S 1 – S 0 \n\n- M 0 = NI / S \n\n- RR = (NI – D) / NI = A.R.E. / NI = 1 – PR \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 232 \n\n\n233 Kenneth S.

Remember: If it wishes to increase assets by $250 in order to achieve its sales objective, it will have to increase the other side of the balance sheet by the same amount. In this case, $25 will be provided internally by accounts payable, $44.10 will be provided internally through",
    " retained earnings, and $180.90 will be provided externally by some mix of debt and equity. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 236 \n\n 236 \n\n\n Note 1: \n\n1. Use _spontaneous_ changes only, that is, AP for     liabilities, exclude Notes Payable (NP) and     Long-term debt (LTD). \n\n2. This was based on a static ratio analysis – our     restrictive assumption. \n\n3. This has been an _incremental_ analysis; we were     only interested in the _additional_ amount of     funds needed, and that’s what we got! \n\n Question #2: How much of the $180.90 will be externally funded by debt and how much by equity? \n\n Question #2, Answer 1: The present debt/equity ratio is 3:7, i.e., 30% debt and 70% equity. Total capital is $1,000, with $300 of debt and $700 of equity (D ÷ TA = 30%). Assuming static analysis, 30% of the $180.90 will be \n\n237 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n financed by debt and 70% by equity. This will maintain the capital ratios in the same proportions as prior to the new external funding. \n\n Que",
    "stion #2, Answer 2: \n\n Another, perhaps better, way of calculating the debt ratio, for this purpose, would be by excluding internal capital from the figures. In this way, we would be establishing only how much external debt and external equity should be raised, an approach, which would be more consistent with the purpose of the EFN formula. We agreed that the firm needs $180.90 of external funds. \n\n Thus presently , external debt ÷ external equity = 200 ÷ 500; that is 28.5% (2/7) in debt as compared to the total of external capital. We had raised $2 of external debt for every $5 of external equity. Total external capital was $700 (5/7) (not the $1,000 in total capital used in the prior calculation). In this alternate calculation, we have ignored internal accounts payable ($100) and retained earnings ($200). Incremental internal funds will be provided over the coming year as in the past. \n\n Below we illustrate both answers. \n\nNote 2: \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 238 \n\n\n In the ",
    "first two expressions in the EFN model, i.e., [(A 0 /S 0 ) ΔS] and [(AP 0 /S 0 ) ΔS], we utilize the incremental, projected sales increase (i.e., ΔS) whereas the third portion [(M 0 ) (S 1 ) (1 – PR 0 )], we utilize the entire projected sales amount (S 1 ). \n\n**Why, in fact, may Financial Ratios change?** \n\nIn the foregoing analysis, we assumed that financial ratios do not change over time. In fact, ratios are dynamic. Here are some reasons why, in fact, ratios will change. \n\n1. **Economies of scale** – as companies     grow larger and produce more, they     benefit, according to Microeconomic     theory, from lower production     costs per unit produced, even though     total (production) costs are rising. The     phenomenon will continue until the     firm reaches full capacity and needs     to add on assets in order to continue     growing. The Asset/Sales and Profit     ratios will be affected. Assets will     remain flat as sales grow – until full     capacity is reached. With uni",
    "t costs     down, gross profits will increase. \n\n2. **“Lumpy Assets”** i.e., firms may reach     a level where they have to acquire     more (expensive) assets (assets don’t     grow smoothly or in the same propor-     tion as the sales increase, which is     likely smoother). For example, the     factory may be at only 60% of capac- \n\n239 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n ity, which affords substantial growth in production and sales without adding on capacity or expanding to an additional facility. Should sales continue to grow beyond present capacity, it would be incumbent upon the firm to add to its fixed assets at some point. Such assets would suddenly jump in size. Sales, by contrast, may grow relatively smoothly over time. The Sales/ Total Asset ratio will provide some insight. \n\n3. **Capital Costs** (i.e., the _economic_     costs to the corporation of borrowing     money and issuing stock) will likely     change over time – interest rates will     go up and down, causing changes in     the ",
    "cost of debt, borrowed money. If     the cost of debt _decreases_ , after-tax     income may _increase_. It will then be     cheaper to finance new fixed assets, so     the firm may then decide to add on     more P, P, & E. The T.I.E. Ratio     (EBIT / Interest Expense) may pro-     vide some added insight here. Also,     stock investors will demand that the     company produce dividends and     increased profits – to be retained if not \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 240 \n\n\n distributed as dividends. Additions to Retained Earnings will increase the company’s value and hence its share price. (Capital Costs should not be confused with Capital Assets Costs.) In short, what investors require or demand, the corporation must provide; return to the investor is an economic cost to the corporation. \n\n241 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n## 9.9 Summary: The Fundamentals of \n\n## Accounting and Financial Analysis \n\nThis might be a good place to review what we have learned thus far. First, we highlighted",
    " some difficulties in reading financial statements for financial analysts. We did this by focusing on examples of current (inventory) and long-term asset accounting (depreciation) respectively. These highlights assisted us in listing and understanding the four primary issues related to accounting data interpretation namely, historical bias, the arbitrary use of cost method, and problems having to do with estimates and reserves. For us, the statements may not be what they seem, with consequent reduced usefulness. If we are going to use accounting data as inputs for ratio analysis, we must first and foremost be cognizant of this, and (later) learn how to adjust the numbers, a skill, which you would acquire in a _Financial Statements Analysis_ course. \n\nBetween highlighting accounting problems and presenting ratio analysis, we discussed the creation of pro forma financial statements and created a projected income statement. We also looked at a model for projecting free cash flow, a very i",
    "mportant predictor of a company’s ongoing performance, and a metric by which possible investment projects are evaluated. Finally, we discussed the _External Funds Needed_ model, an important tool in capital planning in order to accommodate growth. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 242 \n\n 242 \n\n\n## 9.10 Chapters Eight & Nine: Review \n\n## Questions \n\n Chapters 8 – 9: Review Questions \n\n1.

What are the future values (FVs) given each of the following questions? In other words, how much money will you have at the relevant future points in time? (If you had more than $1, the answers would be the appropriate multiple thereof.) \n\nAs we go through the questions and calculations, observe how the outcomes, or solutions, change. Try to explain the reasons for the differences in the outcomes. Also, observe that the seemingly small differences in outcomes are really not as trivial as may seem at first glance. We are illustrating Future Values, in each question, of just one dollar of money that we have now – of **Present Value**. Suppose we were instead dealing with millions of dollars? \n\nAs",
    " we go through each question, we will, methodically and \n\n253 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 253 \n\n\npainstakingly, create a general symbolic formula, which may be employed for any similar problem. Insert the appropriate values into the formulae to solve the problems numerically. (Solutions follow.) \n\n1. You will earn 5% interest, paid once a year, at the END of the year, for one year. \n\n You have $1 now of Present Value (PV). In one year, you will receive your “principal” of $1 back plus interest at an annual rate of return (R) of 5%. A general Future Value (FV) formula will therefore be: \n\n FV = PV (1 + R) \n\n Insert the relevant data into the formula in order to solve for the Future Value. \n\n As we go through this analysis, you will need to learn and remember the symbols or abbreviations. \n\n### 2. Same as question #1, but R = 10%. \n\n Here we will use the same formula as above, but you will insert a different rate for R. What is the Future Value? Why is the outcome different? \n\n### 3. Same as que",
    "stion #2, i.e., R = 10%, but for two \n\n### years (n years), rather than just one. \n\n We will now have two years of compound interest; n = 2. Therefore, we apply the FV formula, slightly modified, a second time: \n\n FV = PV (1 + R) (1 + R) \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 254 \n\n\n FV = PV (1 + R)n \n\n Here, the exponent, “n,” stands for the number of years in which the money compounds.Once again, in this case, n = 2. What is the Future Value? Why is the outcome different than in the prior question? \n\n### 4. 10% interest, twice a year, for one year. \n\n Interest is always quoted as an annual rate, unless explicitly noted otherwise. \n\n Our annual rate is still 10%, but we will receive half of it, i.e., R ÷ p = 0.10 ÷ 2 = 0.05, at the end of each half-year. The letter, “p” stands for the number of compounding periods per year; here p = 2. \n\n FV = PV (1 + R/p)(1 + R/p) \n\n Notice that, while n = 2, there are now two compounding periods per year, so the exponent must reflect that. Our expone",
    "nt is therefore now: “ n × p. ” \n\n Whenever p ≠ 1, we must make two adjustments to the formula: “R/p” in the rate part of the formula and “n × p” in the exponent. While in theory P can take on any integer value, it will actually be equal to 1, 2, 4, 12, or 365 for annually, semi-annually, quarterly, monthly, or daily respectively. (In this example, n = 1; when p = 1, we tend to leave it out as the power of one is implicit.) Our general formula now becomes: \n\n FV = PV (1 + R/p)n × p \n\n255 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n Factor Multiplier Exponential Compounding \n\n Our Future Value formula is now complete. What Future Value do you get? Why is the outcome different than in question #2? \n\n Note that, when solving for Future Value, we multiply the Present Value by a “factor” of (1 + R/p) n × p. A factor is simply a multiplier. This multiplicative and exponential process is referred to as compounding. \n\n### 5. Same as question #4, but for two \n\n### years. \n\n We can employ the formula in the prior quest",
    "ion. Remember, “p” occurs twice in our formula. Here, n = 2, and p = 2. What is your Future Value? Why is the outcome different than in question #3? \n\n6. What happens to future values as interest rates (“R”), the number of years (“n”), and compounding frequency (“p”) increase? In answer to this question, we present, in sum- mary, the “Three Commandments” of the Time Value of Money. \n\n The Three Commandments of TVM \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 256 \n\n\n Discounting Reciprocal \n\n Of course, the opposite will occur if R, N, and/or P decline. Below, we explain Present Values. \n\n7. For each of the above questions, what would be the _pre- sent value_ of $1 to be received at the end of the stated peri- ods? In other words, where in questions 1 though 5, we assumed $1 of PV and had to calculate its FV, we will now assume $1 of FV and calculated its PV using the data in each of the first 5 questions. Here, we will re-employ our Future Value formula, but transpose the FV and PV num- bers ",
    "so that we can solve for PV, rather than for FV. \n\n PV = FV ÷ (1 + R/p)n × p \n\n Thus, when solving for Present Value we divide the Future Value by the (1 + R/ p) n × p factor. This division process is referred to as discounting. \n\n Rather than dividing, we can also multiply the Future Value by the reciprocal of the divisor. \n\n PV = FV × [1 ÷ (1 + R/p)n × p] \n\n Definition: A reciprocal is the inverse of a number, which is arrived at by turning the number upside down! So, 1/2 or 0.5 is the reciprocal of \n\n2. The reciprocal of 5 is 1/5 – or 20%. So, (1 + R/p) n \n\n× p (^) and [1 ÷ (1 + R/p) n × p] are reciprocals of one another. In using Interest Rate Tables (soon), which display ready-made, already-calculated factors, you will note that all the factors’ values are stated as multipli257 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n ers, including the Present Value Factors (PVFs). We will use tables in order to cut down on the number of calculations that we must make and to thereby reduce errors. \n\n8. Is it a reali",
    "stic question to ask what the PV is? How might this actually occur? \n\n Of course it is! We will often know the future payments and wish to figure out the PVs! For example, you may wish to put aside some money for the down payment on a house in “ n ” years. Assuming you know the “discount rate,” how much must you set aside today in order to fund that amount? How much will you need to set aside today to fund your newborn child’s college tuition? A bond pays interest every six months in a known amount. How much should you pay today in order to receive those future amounts? \n\nSolutions and Explanations: \n\nThe $1 in the question is referred to as Present Value (PV). The amount of money we will have in the future is referred to as Future Value (FV). Remember, we are, so far, assuming that the interest payments are made at the _end_ of each relevant payment period. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 258 \n\n\n An investment in knowledge pays the best interest. \n\n -Benjamin Franklin \n\n259 Kenn",

This was represented by the formula: $1 (1.10) = $1.10. \n\nWe noted that if the investor had invested for two years (again at 10% per year) he would have $1.21. This was represented by: $1 (1.10)2 = $1.21. In other words, in the first year, s/he earned $0.10 in interest, while in the second year, he earned $0.11. Why does he earn more interest in the second year if the interest rate – 10% – remains the same? \n\nIn the second year, he once again receives $0.10 interest on his principal investment of $1. However, since he has already earned $0.10 of interest from the prior year, he will also earn 10% on that dime! That is equal to another penny of interest earned: ($0.10) (10%) = $0.01. Thus, in the second year he will have earned another $0.10 ",
    "plus $0.11 or a total of $0.21. The following summarizes this notion: \n\n261 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 261 \n\n\nThis is the nature of interest-on-the-interest: _Compound Interest_! Each year, the interest-on-the-interest will continue to compound. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 262 \n\n\n## 10.4 Some More Simple TVM Problems \n\nWhat is my _Future Value_ under the following scenarios? (After each solution, write out the equivalent mathematical, symbolic notation.) \n\nScenario 1: Assume I have $1 and I invest for one year, receiving an interest payment of .12 at the year’s end. \n\n $1 (1.12) = ___________ \n\nScenario 2: What if I invest for two years, receiving an interest payment of .12 at the end of each year? \n\n $1 (1.12) (1.12) = $1 (1.12)^2 __________ \n\nScenario 3: What if Scenario 1 is changed to account for semi-annual compounding? \n\n $1 (1 + .12/2) 1 x 2^ = __________ \n\nScenario 4: What if Scenario 2 is changed to account for semi-annual compounding? \n\n $1 (1 + .12/2) 2 x 2^ = __________ ",

Bigel \n\n 263 \n\n\n Note: \n\n Asking “what is the present value of some money to be received in the future,” is equivalent to asking how much money is needed today in order to have a certain amount later, assuming a given investment rate. In other words, for a person to have one dollar five years from now, i.e., FV, how much will s/he have to invest today at x%? \n\n### Some More Simple TVM Problems \n\n### (Solutions) \n\n##### 1. $1 (1.12) = $1.12 \n\n##### 2. $1 (1.12) (1.12) = $1 (1.12) 2 = $1.2544 \n\n3. $1 (1 + .12/2) 2 x 1^ = $1 (1.06) 2 = $1.1236 \n\n4. $1 (1 + .12/2) 2 x 2^ = $1 (1.06) 4 = $1.2625 \n\nNotice how the above solutions display the fundamental principles of the _Time Value of Money_ about which we already spoke. Namely, as interest rates, the number of compounding periods per year, and time increase, the Future Value increases and the Present Value decreases. \n\nIt is very easy to ",
    "make mistakes in doing these calculations. For example, remember that the compounding frequency adjustment, “p,” occurs twice in the basic TVM formula; don’t forget to make the relevant adjustments here. Be methodical and go slowly. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 264 \n\n\nIn the end, “eyeball” your solution. If it does not look right in terms of the TVM rules that we already know, it probably is not! It will look correct if it seems to be consistent with the above-cited characteristics of TVM. \n\nSo far, in all the foregoing examples, we have used $1 as present value. This makes it easy to learn and allows one to focus on the manner in which present and future values multiply out. In reality of course, present values would be other, greater numbers, such as $1,237,874.32. All one need do is substitute in the relevant number where heretofore we had the lonely $1 value. \n\n Time is money. -Benjamin Franklin \n\n265 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n## 10.5 Simple Future and Present Values \n\n## (Formu",
    "las) \n\nHaving done the foregoing work, it is plain to see that we can symbolically represent the mathematics using the following “language.” \n\nKey: \n\nThe expression, or “factor,” (1 + R/p) n x p, may be used as a “multiplier” when _compounding_ from present to future values and, in its reciprocal form, as a multiplier again when _discounting_ from future to present values. You will find the factors, calculated out, in interest rate tables, truncated versions of which you will find on the pages following. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 266 \n\n 266 \n\n\n“R/p” means that if the annual interest rate (R) is 12% and the number of compounding periods (p) is 12 (i.e., monthly compounding) the periodic compound rate is .12 ÷ 12 = .01. After one year, the FV would be $1 (1.01)^12 = $1.1268. (Notice that this compares with once–a–year compounding at 12%: $1 (1.12) = $1.12. The difference in Future Values is _not_ trivial. \n\n267 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n## 10.6 Compounding Frequency \n\n## Assumption",
    " \n\nLet’s examine the effect of changing the compounding (or discounting) frequency on both the Presentand FutureValues. Assume that we earn 10% for five years (R = 0.10; _n_ = 5). Assume that we are given $1 of Presentand Future-Values respectively. \n\nNotice how, as “P” increases, FVs increase, and PVs decrease – both at decreasing rates! \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 268 \n\n 268 \n\n\nThe mathematics for continuous compounding and discounting follow on the next page. You will note that the difference between daily and continuous compounding and discounting is very small. Today, we don’t often – if ever – see instruments that exhibit continuous compounding. \n\n269 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n## 10.7 Simple Future and Present Values: \n\n## Continuous Compounding \n\n## (Supplemental) \n\nIn order to solve for continuous compounding, we must engage the “rule of limits” or otherwise utilize the “natural log.” The natural logarithm is the logarithm to the base _e_ , where _e_ is equivalent to the ir",
    "rational number 2.71828. The following presents an exemplary solution for continuous compounding. \n\n FV = PV (e Rn) \n\n and \n\n PV = FV (e -Rn) \n\n Where, e = 2.71828 \n\n R = interest rate \n\n Note: \n\n P is omitted since the compounding is continuous rather \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 270 \n\n 270 \n\n\n than periodic. \n\nExample: PV = $1 \n\n R = .09 \n\n N = 10 years \n\n FV =? \n\nSolution: FV = ($1) (2.71828 (.09) (10)^ ) \n\n = $2.4596 \n\n271 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n## 10.8 Characteristics of the Time Value \n\n## of Money: FV and PV \n\nThe following summarizes and reviews some key characteristics of the _Time Value of Money_ about which we already learned. \n\n- As the interest rate increases, _Future_ Value also     increases. \n\n- As the number of years (n), periods per year (p),     or total periods (n × p) increases, the _Future_     Value increases. \n\n- As the compounding frequency per year     increases, the _Future_ Value increases. \n\n- Restate each of the above statements for _Present_     Val",
    "ues. \n\n- FV and PV factors – or multipliers – are recipro-     cals of one another. \n\nYou will find below a partial interest rate table. If you use such tables properly, you will be able to locate the correct multipliers – or “factors” – for a given situation. You will note that the PV factors are expressed as the reciprocals of their corresponding FVs. In order to arrive at the FV or PV of a specified dollar amount, one need only choose the correct cell and multiply the specific dollar amount by the factor. \n\nFor example, the FV of $1 at 5% for ten years is $1 × \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 272 \n\n 272 \n\n\n1.6289. The PV for 10% compounded semi-annually for five years is $1 × .6139. \n\nIn cases where we have more than one compounding or discounting period per year, we would need to make the same adjustments that were made mathematically earlier. For example, the multiplier for 10% and 5 years semiannually would be found under the 5% column and 10-period row. “Period” in the tabl",
    "es would be equivalent to “n × p” in our, more mathematical, nomenclature. \n\n273 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n## 10.9 Future and Present Value Factors \n\n## (Multipliers) \n\nHere is another look at a somewhat less abbreviated interest rate table. Assume that we are given $1 of Presentand Future-Values respectively. (Fill in the empty 15% column by hand and compare your answers to the factors in the published tables; see the link to Interest Rate Tables below.) Note that, in using tables, “Periods” = n × p. \n\n**Future Value Factors** Formula: FV = PV (1 + R/ p)n×p \n\n**Present Value Factors** Formula: PV = FV ÷ (1 + R/p)n×p \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 274 \n\n 274 \n\n\nHere are some interest rate tables for you to use: \n\n[http://www.retailinvestor.org/pdf/futurevaluetables.pdf](http://www.retailinvestor.org/pdf/futurevaluetables.pdf) \n\n275 Kenneth S.

    "    rate, compounded annually versus a 10%     annual rate, compounded quarter- in terms of     FV of $1? \n\n2. How may the two rates be equated? In other     words, how may I define the _annual_ frequency     at a rate equivalent to the _quarterly_ frequency? \n\n3. What happens as the compounding frequency     increases? \n\n Solution to Question #2: \n\n In general, (1 + R/ p ) np^ = FV Annually, (1.10) 1 = 1.10 versus \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 276 \n\n 276 \n\n\n Quarterly, (1 + .10/4) 1 x 4^ = (1.025) 4 = 1.1038 \n\n That is, 10% quarterly is equivalent to 10.38% annually! In other words, the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) for 10% compounded quarterly, is 10.38%! \n\n277 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n## 10.11 Interpolation \n\nWhat if we have a _fractional_ compound or discount rate \n\n- such as 9.5% – which is not to be found in published tables? Can we still use the tables? Or do we need to solve the problem mathematically (or by financial calculator)? \n\nOne way to get around this is by _estimatin",
    "g_ the multiplier by means of averaging the two whole multipliers that bracket the fractional one in question. We call this process “interpolation” because we _insert_ the average number in between the relevant values or factors, which are stated in the table. Let’s use the future value table below to illustrate this. \n\n Future Value Factors \n\nWhat is the appropriate, estimated future value multiplier for 10 years at 9.5%? This can be approximated by taking the simple average of the multipliers for 9% and 10%: \n\n (2.3674 + 2.5937) ÷ 2 = 2.4806 \n\nThis is only an estimate. Remember that time value factors increase (in this case – or decrease in the case of present values) at an _exponential_ rate. The true mathematical future value for 9.5% for 10 years is: \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 278 \n\n 278 \n\n\n##### 1.095^10 = 2.4782 \n\nThis differs from the simple average estimate, of 2.4806 – 2.4782 = 0.002. We first note that the simple average produces a higher number than the true, exp",
    "onential figure; this is notable. This is as expected because, in dealing with future value factors, the numbers grow exponentially or more quickly, and thus we would start off with a lower number. Put differently, we do not grow from 9% to 10% at a linear rate, but at an increasing, curvilinear rate. \n\n279 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n## 10.12 Interpolation Illustrated \n\nInterpolation may be useful in order to estimate future (and present-) values when one does not wish, or have the ability, to calculate more precise measures. The reason for the error has to do with the curvilinear relationship between (discountand) compound interest rates and their related multipliers. This is best seen by illustration. \n\nOne may readily see that, by connecting the asterisks, the interpolated value of 2.4806 resides on a straight line between the correctly calculated future value multipliers for 9% and 10% respectively. \n\nHowever, the time value of money is not linear. Any time an exponent is involved, you wi",
    "ll not get a linear relationship, but a curvilinear outcome of some sort. Hence, the correct multiplier for 9.5% is 2.4782, which is lower \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 280 \n\n 280 \n\n\nthan the interpolated arithmetic average of 2.4806. If one joins the asterisks for 9% and 10% to the mathematically calculated middle value of 2.4782 (represented by “#”), one readily observes the curvilinear relationship between compound interest rates and their respective multipliers. In short, as rates increase, future values increase in non-linear fashion. Correspondingly, present values would decrease non-linearly. The non-linear nature of these curves will soon be discussed in greater depth when we get to “Volatility.” Basic mathematical examples will be presented. \n\n281 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n## 10.13 Some TVM Practice Questions \n\n You will need to solve all these problems by hand. You will not be able to use the tables. \n\n1. You are given the following.

Which     will you prefer? \n\n3. Bonus question: You will receive $24,000,     $29,500, $58,000 and $87,000 each year con-     secutively for the next four years. What are     both the Present- and Future-Values of this     _uneven_ income stream? Assume an annual rate     of 4.6%. (We will learn how to do _Uneven Cash_     _Flows_ after we do _Annuities_ – below.) **Solutions** \n\n1. ($2,800) (1 + 0.0054/4) 8 x 4= **$2,923.5256** \n\n2.

Interestingly, it is also true that $173,262.78 ×1.046 (to the fourth) = $207,411.11. If you had already calculated the Present Value of this uneven series of cash flows, you would not have had to go through the long calculation of the Future Value. \n\n(If you have trouble with this, it’s OK. We will get to _Uneven Cash Flow_ series soon. You can come back to it later.) \n\n283 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n## 10.14 The Volatility of the Time Value \n\n## of Money \n\nDiscrepancies in TVM factors will widen as time increases, as one observes the relative factors between interest rate columns. \n\nFor example, a five-year IOU with a future value of $1,000, using the tables, would have a present value of $1,000 (0.7835) = $783.50 – at a discount rate ",
    "of 5%. The IOU could be purchased or sold for that amount, or price. Think of present value as an item’s dollar price. If the discount rate instead were 10%, the present value would be only: $1,000 (0.6209) = $620.90. In percentage terms, the present value of $1,000 to be received five years from now, discounted at a rate of 5% is greater than at 10% by a difference of (783.5 ÷ 620.9) – 1 = **26.2%.** \n\nIf however the IOU had a 30-year term, the difference in present value would itself compound. At 5%, the present value would equal $1,000 (0.2314) = $231.40. At 10%, the PV would equal $1,000 (0.0573) = $57.30. In percentage terms, the present value of $1,000 to be received thirty years from now, discounted at a rate of 5% is greater than at 10% by a difference of (231.4 ÷ 57.30) – 1 = **303.8%**. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 284 \n\n 284 \n\n\n Key Terms: \n\n Geometry \n\n 5% 10% Percentage Difference 5% over 10% \n\n 5 Years 0.7835 0.6209 (783.5 ÷ 620.9) – 1 = 26% \n\n 30 Years 0.2314 0.",
    "0573 (231.4 ÷ 57.30) – 1 = 303% \n\n This demonstrates the volatility and geometry of TVM! By geometry here we refer to its non-linear and exponential nature. Whenever there is an exponent in a formula, we get some kind of curve. As time increases, differences in presentand future-values for a given number of years themselves increase non-linearly. \n\nIf you had purchased a thirty-year IOU as an investment, any changes in interest rates (i.e., due to market conditions) would have a far greater impact on the value of your IOU investment than if you had, instead, purchased a five-year obligation. For a given change in discount rates of interest, the impact on the multipliers is greater the greater the time is. The impact on price, which is present value, is greater, the greater the time–period. “Price volatility,” so to speak, increases as the future payment grows more distant. \n\nAgain, this is because, the time value of money is non-linear; it is exponential.

Would it be same percentage change? \n\n**Rates of Change in TVM Factors** \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 286 \n\n\n Years Discount Rate \n\n Percentage Difference In Present Value: \n\n 5% over 10% \n\n (Rate of Change) \n\n 5% 10% First Derivative \n\n 5 0.7835 0.6209 (783.5 ÷ 620.9) – 1 = 26% \n\n 10 0.6139 0.3855 (0.6139 ÷ 0.3855) – 1 = 59% \n\n 15 0.4810 0.2394 (0.4810 ÷ 0.2394) – 1 = 101% \n\n 20 0.3769 0.1486 (376.9 ÷ 148.6) – 1 = 154% \n\n 25 0.2953 0.0923 (0.2953 ÷ 0.0923) – 1= 220% \n\n 30 0.2314 0.0573 (231.4 ÷ 57.30) – 1 = 303%",

Your profit would be much greater had you invested in the thirty-year obligation. While this case is exaggerated, the bond market works in similar fashion. Bond prices can, at times, be quite volatile due to changes in market rates although large changes do not occur instantaneously) except in the case of a disaster). Remember: prices are the present values of a bond’s future payments! \n\nThese relationships can also be illustrated using Differential Calculus, whic",
    "h would give you a more “continuous,” rather than a “discrete,” view of the progress of the numbers. \n\nThe Take-away: If interest rates change, (bond) prices could change dramatically!! \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 288 \n\n\n## 10.15 The First and Second Derivatives \n\n## Illustrated \n\n- We have just demonstrated that changes in     longer-term discount rates affect present value     (i.e., prices) more than in the case of short-term     rates and cash flows. In our example, the rate of     changes in present value factors increased in     time, e.g., from 26%, to 101%, to 303%. \n\n- However, the rate of increase is decreasing (i.e.,     “deceleration” or second derivative), e.g., from     126%, to 71%, to 38%. \n\n- In Calculus, we would say here that the first     derivative is positive while the second derivative     is negative. If we think of the price of the cash     flows as distance covered as a function of time     (“speed”), then we can think of the “First Deriv-     ative.",
    "” We can think of the “Second Derivative”     here as the change in the rate of speed (“deceler-     ation”) Were the second derivative positive, we     would be speaking of “acceleration.” We     observe these characteristics in this diagram: \n\n289 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 289 \n\n\nImagine a payment due in the future; its present value would be determined by its rate – a short-term rate (and PVF!) for a short-term payment and so on. The rate of change in present value was noted in the first derivative column, while the “rate of change in the rate of change” in the present value was noted in the second derivative column. \n\nIn other words, as time increases, the differences in present values – for 5% versus 10% – increase, but the rate of increase decreases! Remember: the price of a financial asset today is its present value! \n\nThe Take-away (again): If rates change, prices (i.e., present values) could change dramatically!! \n\n Interest (lit. “bite”).

    "“Annuities Due,” meaning that the CFs occur at the start of the relevant periods. \n\nIf, as in most cases, the cash flows do not qualify as an annuity, then their FV/PVs may be derived only by calculating the FV/PV of each discrete CF and then aggregating. \n\nThis is the same process by which we shall derivethe “short-cut” Annuity TVM factors. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 296 \n\n 296 \n\n\n## 11.3 The Derivation of (Ordinary) \n\n## Annuity Factors \n\nYou are given the following information.

Once completed, add up the columns at the bottom. \n\nNote that here we are dealing with “ordinary” annuities, which means that all the cash flows in the series are received at the _end_ of the relevant period. Soon, we will examine another convention. Use the timeline belo",
    "w to properly place each of the three cash flows temporarily (see the timeline below). Placement will determine the proper exponents and hence periods. \n\nGiven: \n\n3-year annuity \n\n$100 received per year. \n\nAnnual Discounting/Compounding Factor = R = .10 \n\n297 Kenneth S.

Note that if you had an interest rate table for annuities, you would be able to multiply the annuity cash flow (in this case, $100) by the appropriate factor. You would then arrive at the futureor present-values of the cash flows, in one step. Such annuity interest tables exist; a link is provided at the bottom of this page. \n\nWhat may w",
    "e observe from this table? Future value annuity factors are always greater than the number of periods. Here the FVF was 3.31, or greater than n · p = 3 periods. This is because the annuity multiplier is the sum of each respective yearly factor, each of which is greater than 1.0 (except the last one, which = 1.0) since they are all multiples of (1 + R) n. (This assumes that R > 0.) \n\nContrarily, each PVF is less than the number of periods because the respective factors are all less than 1.0, as each factor is the reciprocal of (1 + R) n. (Again, this assumes that R > 0.) \n\nWhen utilizing a table, it is always a good idea to “eyeball” \n\n299 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 299 \n\n\nthe factors you are using to make sure you didn’t lift the figure from the wrong table or make some other error. Use your head at all times.

Let’s assume that the Cash Flows are to be received at the end of the respective periods. In the examples following, there are five cash flows. \n\nCompounding: \n\nThere are, altogether, four compounding “periods”; the last cash flow to be received is not compounded because it is received at the “horizon” of the deal. Indeed, the last CF does have a zero-exponent attached to it: [1 + R] 0 = 1. The exponents are zero through four. \n\nDiscounting: \n\nIn contrast, there are five di",
    "scounting periods. The exponents are one through five. Note that the arrows go in the opposite direction from before as we are now discounting to present values rather than compounding to future values. \n\n301 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 301 \n\n\nWhile Simple Future and Present Values factors (as observed by the relevant tables earlier) are reciprocals, or mirror images of one another, annuities are not. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 302 \n\n\n## 11.6 Future and Present Annuity \n\n## Factors: Mathematical Formulas \n\nLet’s “put on the table” the formal mathematical formulas for ordinary annuities’ factors. Remember: a “factor” is a multiplier (for the given cash flows). These formulae will be useful when your tables do not have a particular interest rate that you need, and especially when you need to calculate a fractional rate, e.g., 10.23%. \n\nKey: PVAF – Present Value Annuity Factor.

    "ue Annuity Factor (FVAF) must     always be __________ than the number of com-     pounding periods. \n\n- The Present Value Annuity Factor (PVAF) must     always be __________ than the number of dis-     counting periods. \n\n- FVAFs and PVAFs, unlike simple TVM factors,     are not reciprocals of one another for the follow-     ing reasons: \n\n1. The counting of the time periods is different for     each, i.e., the timelines and “arrows’ directions”     are different, therefore so are the simple factors’     respective exponents! \n\n2. The annuity factors are themselves the result of     an additive (aggregating) process for which reci-     procals do _not_ apply, e.g., 1 ÷ (1 + 2 + 3) ≠1/1 +     ½ + 1/3. The reciprocal of a sum is not equal to     the sum of reciprocals. \n\n305 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 305 \n\n\nThe answers to the fill-ins above are: \n\n- The FVAF must always be – _greater_ – than the     number of compounding periods. \n\n- The PVAF must always be – _less_ – than the     number of d",

The FV of the     $100 annuity at 10% in comparison will be     $100 ×164.49 = $16,449 \n\n2. Notice how quickly both the present and future     value annuity factors increase. That is because     we are constantly adding additional cash flows     each year. That is also why the PVAFs increase,     in contrast to the simple PV factors, which, of     course, may only decrease – as per our three     commandments – as time increases. \n\n Key: \n\nPVAF = Present Value Annuity Factor \n\nFVAF = Future Value Annuity Factor \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 306 \n\n\n307 Kenneth S.

To illustrate, we will use the example – and chart – from above. Since the timing of the cash flows is different than in an ordinary annuity, the factors (and exponents) are also different. As you fill in the factors and th",
    "e dollar amounts, draw the appropriate timeline. Question: What would be the PV and FV for the $100 three-year annuity at 10%? \n\n Timeline \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 310 \n\n 310 \n\n\n Questions: \n\n1. Notice that both PV and FV annuity due factors     (and dollars therefore) are larger than the     respective ordinary annuity factors. \n\n2. The PV of an annuity due is equal to the PV of     an ordinary annuity multiplied by one plus the     _discount_ rate (1 + R/P)^1 for one period. \n\n3. The FV of an annuity due is equal to the FV of     an ordinary annuity multiplied by the _com-_     _pound_ rate for one period. Show this mathe-     matically. \n\n311 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n## 11.10 Annuities Due (Solutions) \n\nQuestion: What would be the PV and FV for a $100 threeyear _annuity due_ at 10%? \n\n Note: \n\n The PV and FV for an ordinary annuity with the same term (time), rate of interest, and dollar amounts, were calculated at $248.68 and $331 respectively. Since an annuity due provides ",
    "each of its cash flows one period earlier than the ordinary annuity, the PV and FV of the annuity are both equal to the ordinary annuity multiplied by (1 +R/p)^1. In this case, that would be: \n\n $248.68 (1.10)^1 = $273.55 \n\n $331.00 (1.10)^1 = $364.10 \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 312 \n\n 312 \n\n\nDue to the fact that the cash flows come in sooner there are both more compounding periods and fewer discounting periods. The fewer number of periods leads to more compounding and less discounting, hence greater futureand present-values. \n\nThis is handy to know because most interest rate tables provide ordinary annuities factors, but not annuities due. \n\n313 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n## 11.11 Adjustment from Ordinary \n\n## Annuity to Annuity Due \n\nThe PV and FV for an ordinary annuity with the same term, rate of interest, and dollar amounts, were calculated earlier at $248.68 and $331 respectively. (See the table at the bottom of this page for a key summary of the differences in exponents.) Sin",
    "ce an annuity due provides each of its cash flows one period earlier than the ordinary annuity, the PV and FV of the annuity is equal to the respective ordinary annuity factors multiplied by (1 +R/p)^1. (Note that in all instances the exponent is one because the cash flows are pulled ahead just one period.) In this case that would be: \n\n $248.68 (1.10)^1 = $273.55 \n\n $331.00 (1.10)^1 = $364.10 \n\nThe fact that the cash flows are received (or paid) sooner in the example of an annuity due has an interesting implication (as noted in the adjustment formula above). In the case of the PV, there will be fewer discounting periods than with an ordinary annuity, so the PV will be higher. In the case of the FV, there will be more compounding periods, hence the FV is also higher. Again, in both instances, the ordinary annuity factor is adjusted by a multiple of (1 +R/ p)^1. Note that even when p ≠ 1, the exponent will always be one, representing just the one period (even if part of a year) in which",
    " the series is “pulled ahead.” \n\nQuestion: How would the adjustment in our example be \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 314 \n\n 314 \n\n\nmade if the compounding frequency instead were semiannual? \n\nAnswer: In this case, one would multiply by (1 +R/p)^1 = (1 + 0.10 / 2)^1 = (1.05)^1. \n\n315 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n## 11.12 Uneven Cash Flows \n\nNot all cash flows series are as neat as annuities. Using the TVM Tables, calculate both the PV and FV for the series of Uneven Cash Flows presented below. Assume a periodic discount/compound rate of 6%. \n\nThe method by which this exercise will be done is the same as that which was done for deriving ordinary annuity factors earlier – except that the cash flows here are uneven (or unequal) rather than all the same. While we have already done a similar exercise earlier, well, you know, practice makes perfect! \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 316 \n\n 316 \n\n\n## 11.13 Uneven Cash Flows (Solutions) \n\nSolution Guidelines: First, fill-in the first or upper",

Next, multiply each cash flow horizontally by the appropriate PVF. Aggregate. \n\nIn order to complete the FVF column, start at the bottommost cell and fill in 1.00; in the next cell up, fill in 1.06. As you go up, continue multiplying by 1.06.

You will also \n\n317 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 317 \n\n\nnote that, if you know the PV of the uneven series, you can simply multiply it by (1 + Rn) in order to arrive at the FV of the series.

Bigel \n\n 323 \n\n\n Key Terms: \n\n Perpetuity \n\n Infinite Nominal \n\n## 11.18 Perpetuities: No-Growth \n\n## Perpetuities \n\nA **perpetuity** is a series of equal cash flows that arrive in equal intervals and are never-ending, a kind of forever annuity. We cannot evaluate its FV since it would be **infinite** , as would be its **nominal** value. However, we _can_ figure the PV. \n\nThe PV of a perpetuity is simply the (fixed) payment divided by the interest rate. For example, if the cash flows are $100 and the discount rate is 10%, the PV would be: \n\n PV = $100 ÷ .10 = $1,000 \n\nThe general formula would thus be: \n\n PV = CF ÷ i \n\nThis works because of the mathematical “law of limits.” Simply put, as the cash flows grow more distant, the respective PV",
    "s of these cash flows approach zero. Adding increasingly distant cash flows will have an infinitesimalimpact on the outcome, the present value. Thus, the \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 324 \n\n 324 \n\n\nsum can be calculated as mentioned. Let us examine this further. \n\nFor example, a $100 annuity for five years at 10% has a PV of $379.08. A ten-year annuity has a PV of $614.46. An annuity of 25 years has a PV of $907.70 and a 50-year annuity would be $991.48. As time goes on, the PV of each additional year’s cash flow becomes very, very small (i.e., time increases, PV decreases) so that adding such _infinitesimal_ amounts provides no material addition to the aggregate. In the end, you will note that the above present values, when aggregated, will eventually approach, and theoretically equal $1,000. \n\nThis formula is applicable to preferred stock whose dividends ad infinitum are fixed. \n\n325 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n## 11.19 The “Law of Limits” and \n\n## Perpetuities \n\nWe have already seen",
    " that present value of a perpetuity can be described by the formula: P 0 = CF ÷ i. We have also provided both the algebraic derivation of this formula and a discussion as to how the present value of a perpetuity approaches (but never quite reaches) the price described by the formula. \n\nStill, many students find the idea of limits – and of the infinitesimal – difficult to grasp. Our intent here is to further elucidate the notion that present values decrease over time with the result that distant cash flows become so small, so infinitesimal – they have so many decimal places \n\n- that they add virtually nothing to the aggregate present value. In making this observation, you will also note that, as a result, the cumulative value of the perpetuity’s present value approaches the theoretical price described by the for- mula, as posited by mathematicians. This is as it should be. \n\nLet us say that a perpetuity’s cash flows are $1 and the interest rate at which we shall discount the series is 1",
    "0%. The present value therefore would be: P 0 = $1 ÷ .10 = $10. This is confirmed in the table below. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 326 \n\n 326 \n\n\nAfter 25 years, we reach 90% of the aforecited aggregate present value, and by the 50thyear, we exceed 99% of the $10 value. With the passage of more time, we shall get closer and closer to $10, but only reach $10 in infinite space. \n\n### Perpetuities: Pondering the Infinite \n\n He counts the number of the stars; to all of them, He assigns names. \n\n327 Kenneth S.

There are no limits. There are only plateaus, and you must not stay there, you must go beyond them._ -Bruce Lee \n\n Introduction to",
    " Financial Analysis 328 \n\n\n## 11.20 Growth Perpetuities \n\nA “growth” perpetuity is a perpetual cash flow stream (CF) that grows at a _constant_ rate of growth, which we shall call “ _g_ .” It is a special case of perpetuity. If, in the last period, we received a cash flow of $100 and its growth rate is 5%, the next cash flow would follow this formula: (Last Cash flow: CF 0 ) (1 + g) = Cash flow in next period (CF 1 ). “G” represents a constant rate of growth in the cash flow over time. \n\n CF 1 = CF 0 (1 + g) \n\n $105 = $100 (1.05) \n\nThe formula for a growth-perpetuity is: (Cash flow (^) next period) ÷ (Discount rate – Growth rate). Symbolically, this may be expressed as: PV = CF 1 ÷ ( _r – g_ ) In the above example (where r = 0.10), if the growth rate had been 5%, the present value would be (assuming here that the _next_ CF is $105, that is, [$100] [1.05] = $105): $105 ÷ (.10– .05) = $2,100 Notice that for this formula to work, “g” cannot equal or exceed “r.” Mathematically, if g exceed",
    "s r we would get a negative denominator, resulting in a negative present value, which makes no sense. A mathematical rationale, while 329 Kenneth S. Bigel 329 \n\n\n Key Terms: \n\n Negative Growth \n\n necessary, is however not sufficient to justify this relationship. There must be a financial explanation. \n\n One, theoretically, earns some positive return – “r” – for investing in a no-risk asset 1 ; otherwise, no one would invest at all. Even with no risk (and no growth!), there is a positive return. Therefore r > g. As growth rates increase (in linear manner), so too does risk; higher growth rates are more difficult to achieve and hence are riskier. R (“r”) should exceed g, as a practical, non-mathematical matter. This is depicted in the diagram below. \n\n This formula may also come in handy for cases of negative growth. Since “g” would be negative, in this case, the formula would require that one add the growth rate to the interest rate in order to determine the present value. \n\n Suppose th",
    "e last cash flow (CF 0 ) was $100, there is a nominal cash flow growth rate of negative 5%, and a discount rate of 10%. What would the present value be? \n\n1. As this is being written (2021), we observe an unusual environment wherein     interest rates in many parts of the world are negative. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 330 \n\n\n##### [($100) (1 – (0.05)] ÷ [.10 – (-.05)] = \n\n##### $95 ÷ .15 = $633.34 \n\nOf course, the PV in the case of positive growth far exceeds the outcome we observed with negative growth. Is that not as it should be? \n\nThis formula is applicable to common stock, whose dividends may grow – positively or negatively. \n\n Note: \n\n Looking at this graph alone one may conclude that, at some point, r < g. This is because the line is steeper than at a horizontal plane, thus, there would be less “rise” than “run,” leading eventually to growth exceeding the discount rate, and producing a negative present value. While this may be true if one limits the analysis to the gr",
    "aph alone, it cannot be correct, in fact, that dividend growth is not reflected in return – which is also the discount rate, and part of the denominator. As dividends rise, so too must return. (Remember: discounting and compounding are the same; just the arrows go in different directions.) This anomalous and paradoxical case will be discussed in depth when we discuss the “Dividend Discount Model.” \n\n331 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n## 11.21 Fractional Time Periods \n\nSo far, we have dealt only with whole periods and, therefore, whole exponents. True, you may argue that we have also broken whole periods into halves (or other pieces), such as (whole period) half years, so that, for example, an annual rate of 10% compounded / discounted semi-annually became 5% per period; exponents were still whole numbers. But let’s not stop here! \n\nOccasionally, cash flows may occur before the end of a period. Suppose you earn 10% per year, compounded daily. What would be the FV after ¾ of a year? \n\nIf we assume ",
    "a 360-day year^13 , ¾ ×360 = 270 days. (In short-term financial analysis, we often deal with, or otherwise assume, twelve 30-day months to a year.) Further, 10% ÷360 = .0002777. Therefore, after 270 days, you will have earned: \n\n $1 (1 + .10/360) 270 = \n\n $1 (1.0002777) 270 = 1.077850 \n\nBy comparison, if the compounding period is three months or a quarter of a year, then: \n\n 1 (1 + .10/4) 3 = 1.0769 \n\nIf, in fact,the compounding period is a whole year, then we may employ a fractional exponent: \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 332 \n\n 332 \n\n\n##### 1 (1.10) 3/4= 1.0741 \n\nAll of the foregoing choices are arithmetically correct. The compounding convention you use matters. In practice, you will have to know the proper convention commonly used in each situation. \n\nHere are some more examples. Notice that if we calculate the FV of $1 at 10% annually, after half a year we would have arrived at an FV of $1.05 ($1 (1 + .10/2)^1 ) – as we may have assumed until now. However, if we use fractio",
    "nal exponents, we get a slightly different result: \n\n $1 (1.10)1/2^ = $1.048809 \n\n $1 (1 + .10/2)^1 P ≠ $1 (1.10)1/2 \n\nIt is therefore very important to understand the context of the problem and the use of the appropriate compounding/ discounting convention. \n\nThe Take-away: Compounding assumptions matter. Be sure you use the correct assumptions. \n\n333 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n## 11.22 Loans: The Conventional \n\n## Mortgage \n\nMortgages are different from ordinary loans. With most loans, interest is paid over the term, or life, of the loan, and the entire principal is paid in one fell swoop at the loan’s term, or maturity. In contrast, mortgages are self-amortizing, which means that all payments include portions of both interest and principal, resulting in decreasing principal balances over time until, at maturity, the entire loan will have been paid off. Let us see, by way of (an unrealistic) example how this may work. \n\n Given: Principal: $100,000 Rate: 9 % \n\n Term: 10 Years Period: Yearly ",
    "\n\nMathematical Rationale: \n\nThe loan proceeds, i.e., $100,000 in this case, represent the present value. The “periodic payment” represents the annuity payments to be made over future years and will include both Interest and Amortization. Amortization goes toward the reduction of the loan or principal balance. The present value of the annuity payments should equal the loan principal: \n\n Principal = Periodic Payment x Present Value Annuity Factor \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 334 \n\n 334 \n\n\nCalculation: \n\nPayment = Principal ÷ PV Annuity Factor = $ 100,000 ÷ 6.42 = $ 15,576.32 \n\nInterest = Opening Balance × Rate Amortization = Annuity Payment less Interest \n\nBalance = Opening Balance less Amortization \n\nPayment and Amortization Schedule: \n\nIn the first year, the interest portion of the payment is 9% of $100,000 or $9,000. This leaves $15,576 less $9,000 = $6,576 going toward _amortization_. The new, _amortized balance_ is hence $100,000 less $6,576 = $93,424. Each year the annuity",
    " installment is first used to pay the interest on the loan and the balance is used to reduce the capital outstanding. This continues for each period until maturity. In the maturity year the last annuity installment is sufficient to cover the interest still owed and the remaining balance. (You will note a rounded number in the last year.) \n\n335 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\nNote: \n\n Mortgage payments are usually made in MONTHLY installments, and often with greater maturities. Mortgages in the USA today are at least 15 years in term and usually up to 30 years. Rates as of this writing are also substantially lower than illustrated. This has been simplified for illustration purposes, so that the reader may easily refer to standard interest rate tables. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 336 \n\n\n## 11.23 A Few Thoughts about \n\n## Mortgages \n\nThere are a few key points regarding mortgages, which require summary and notice. \n\n1. Interest payments are tax deductible. Tax     deductibility is important",
    " simply because it     reduces the after-tax cost of the mortgage. Funds     that would otherwise have gone to pay tax     instead go to debt service. This benefit is     reduced as the interest portion of the mortgage     payment is reduced with time. \n\n2. Partway through the loan, half the loan will have     been paid off. A mortgage has a kind of “half-     life.” In the foregoing example, half the loan     will have been paid off after six years. This half-     life will be greater than half the length of the     mortgage because initially the annuity payments     are used mainly to pay interest on the loan! \n\n3. Total interest paid may be much greater than and     in longer-term cases, a multiple of the principal \n\n- this can be calculated by evaluating the total payments minus the principal. \n\nIn the foregoing example, over the ten years the borrower will have paid a total of 10 annual payments of $15,576.32 for a total of $155,763.20. If you subtract from this figure the loan pr",
    "incipal of $100,000, you are left with a figure of \n\n337 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 337 \n\n\n$55,763.20, which represents the total amount of interest paid over the life of the mortgage (unadjusted for time value). In other words, interest paid represents an additional 55% approximately of the principal borrowed. (We take note again that most mortgages require monthly payments and that, in today’s marketplace, most mortgages are 15 to 30 years.) \n\nLet us compare 15and 30-year mortgages in terms of the ratio of interest payments made relative to the principal. We remind ourselves that in the above instance (10 years and 9%) we had 55% interest payments relative to the loan principal. Let us use $100,000 of principal again, and, this time, 6% in interest. We shall again employ the formula: \n\n Principal ÷ PV Annuity Factor = Periodic Payment \n\n15 years: ($100,000) ÷ (9.7122) = $10,296.33 \n\nOver 15 years total payments will equal (15) ($10,296.33) = $154,444.95. In this case, interest payments will",
    " equal 54.44% of the principal. \n\n30 years: ($100,000) ÷ (13.7648) = $7,264.91 \n\nOver 30 years, total payments will equal (30) ($7,264.91) = $217,947.30. In this case, interest payments will equal 117.95% of the principal. \n\nEven though the annual payments are less in the 30-year case, we see that interest payments multiply enormously over time. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 338 \n\n\n## 11.24 Summary Comparison of 15and \n\n## 30-Year Mortgages \n\nThe following table presents a comparison of the $100,000 annual pay mortgage (above) at 6% interest for 15and 30-years. \n\n Notes and Questions: \n\n- The shorter-term mortgage presents a higher     periodic payment requirement but entails less     overall interest payments over time. \n\n- The longer-term mortgage presents a much     higher total interest payment requirement but     requires a lower periodic outlay. \n\n- Question: Under what conditions does it pay to     take out the shorter-term mortgage? \n\n- Answer: It pays if the mortgagee ",
    "has sufficient     cash flow, and wishes to minimize total pay- \n\n339 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 339 \n\n\n ments, especially interest, over time. \n\n- Question: Under what conditions does it pay to     take out the longer-term mortgage? \n\n- Answer: It pays if one does not have sufficient     cash flow, is unwilling to settle for a less-costly     home, and is relatively unconcerned about the     long-term, larger amount to be paid; perhaps he     does not intend to stay for the full thirty years. \n\n- In most circumstances, a 15-year mortgage will     bear a lower rate than a 30-year mortgage –     unlike this illustration. Here we focused on a     single variable – time – which greatly impacts     the scenario depicted relative to the minimal     impact that a small premium interest rate would     have for the increased term to maturity. \n\n- Taxation will also have an effect. Recall that     interest payments on mortgages are, under cur-     rent law, tax-deductible. \n\nThe mortgage formula is im",

It is central to all of financial analysis and must be mastered. It is a basic tool. \n\nIn the prior two chapters, we developed a rationale for assessing “simple” futureand present-values. We defined the two qualifications for a cash flow series’ being categorized as an annuity, and then defined an ordinary annuity as the sum of the series’ presentand future-values. We further defined “annuities due” and outlined a means for converting an ordinar",
    "y annuity into an annuity due. Additionally, we determined how interest rate tables may be used as a shortcut tool for calculating the time value of money. \n\nThen we assessed uneven cash flow series that do not qualify as annuities. We examined two cases of perpetuities (no-growth and growth) as a special case of annuity. We examined fractional time periods and discovered the arbitrary nature of certain time value calculations, which have to do with the varying conventions regarding the definition of “period” and the use of interest rates in this regard. Finally, an illustration of a mortgage was presented and evaluated. \n\n“Before one continues further in this text, it is imperative \n\n345 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 345 \n\n\nthat the student master fully the critical concept of time value of money in all its variety.” \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 346 \n\n\n## 11.27 Chapters 10 11: Review \n\n## Questions \n\n1.

The two principal components of return are income and profit, i.e., sales or “exit” price less investment cost. Income is common to many assets including bonds (interest), stocks (dividends), and real estate (rent). The exit price may be equal to, greater or less than the asset’s original investment cost, hence “profit” is included in return. \n\nExample: \n\n- Stock/bond/real estate cost or investment (C) =     $1,000. This is an “outflow.” \n\n- In",
    "come (I) received over the course of the hold-     ing period = $100. \n\n- Sales (exit) price (P) = $1,050. \n\n- The income and sales price are “inflows.” \n\nHolding Period Return (HPR): \n\n HPR = inflows ÷ outflows -1 = [(I + P) / C] – 1 \n\n353 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 353 \n\n\n##### HPR = [(100 + 1,050) / 1,000] – 1 = + 15% \n\nAlternatively, we could have calculated the HPR by focusing only on the profit (“ _Π_ ”), in which case, we would have left out the “-1” expression at the end. Note that the profit = $1.050 – $1,000 = $50. The result is the same this way as depicted below. \n\n HPR = [(I + Π ) / C] \n\n HPR = [(100 + 50) / 1,000] = + 15% \n\n Note: \n\n In either application, this is a “raw” calculation in that it does not account for the time value of money. This approach ignores the length of the holding period and the timing of the cash flows. Clearly one would rather earn the raw 15% return over a shorter period than longer. Would you rather 15% over one year or ten? A dollar earned today is wo",
    "rth more than a dollar earned tomorrow. \n\nWhile the HPR has severe conceptual limits, it provides key information upon which a better model may be constructed. In this section, we will present the calculation for dollar price and return of a bond. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 354 \n\n\n When you make a sale to your fellow…do not victimize one another. -Leviticus 25:1 \n\n And when you transact a purchase to your friend, or acquire from the hand of your friend, you shall not defraud one another. -Leviticus 25:14 \n\n355 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n## 12.3 Valuation Premise \n\nSo, the HPR is not acceptable because it does not include the critical notion of time value of money. In general, we will find that the (dollar-) valuation of any asset will adhere to the following rule: \n\n The value of an (financial) asset is equal to \n\n the future cash flows the asset is expected to produce, \n\n each of which cash flow is discounted to its present value \n\n and then all such present values are aggregated ",
    "to \n\n a single value. \n\nThis says that in valuing an asset, we must first identify its future cash flows, and then discount each of those cash flows at an appropriate discount rate, and aggregate the figures into a sum, which shall be the asset’s valuation or price. \n\nWe will also find that, in a certain sense, the dollar value and the discount rate are interchangeable; in fact, we will note that the discount rate, in a large sense, is the “true” price of the asset. \n\nThese premises are not universally applicable nor accepted \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 356 \n\n 356 \n\n\nby all analysts and researchers, but are nonetheless essential to finance. \n\n357 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n## 12.4 Fixed Income Securities: Bond \n\n## Components and Valuation Formula \n\nSince the coupon cash flow of a bond constitutes an annuity, the calculation of a bond’s dollar price involves a simple solution: \n\nThe above formula says that every (annuity) coupon payment plus the one-time face value payment are disco",
    "unted and aggregated to present value, which is the bond’s price. This is based on our “valuation premise.” Here are some important terms to know: \n\nFace Value = Maturity Value = Par Value = Principal: These phrases are synonymous and interchangeable. Maturity value is the amount of money the investor, or bondholder/lender, gets back when the bond matures. This represents, in most instances (and herewith) a one-time cash inflow to the investor. \n\nCoupon Rate (C) = Interest Rate (I): This is the amount of interest that the bond pays. (An exception would be a variable rate, but we do not deal with that here.) The dollar amount paid is this rate times the face value. Thus, if the \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 358 \n\n 358 \n\n\nrate is 10% and the Face Value is $1,000, it will pay $100 per year. If this bond pays semi-annually, the investor will receive two $50 payments per year, one every six months. This represents an annuity series of cash flows for the life of the bond; this is the",
    " bond’s second set of cash flows. \n\nYield-to-Maturity (YTM) = Market Rate = Discount Rate:This is the market-determined rate at which the bond’s cash flows – both the Face Value and the coupon payments – are “priced,” or discounted, to present value. Do not confuse coupon and market rates; they are separate and mathematically distinct. The market yield will constantly change. Coupons are (generally) fixed. \n\nWe may think of Face Valueand the bond’s Dollar Pricein terms of $100s or $1,000s or any multiple thereof. Since the bond’s price is expressed in terms of 100% of the bond’s “Par” value, it doesn’t matter for calculation purposes, how many zeros we add on in an illustration or exercise. This will be demonstrated immediately below. \n\nThe bond trader will quote the bond in terms of a percent of par and will then ask the buyer or seller what the “size” of the trade is? In other words, how much they are dealing with. Of course, in reality, buying or selling a thousand, or a million, do",
    "llars’ worth of bonds matters a great deal. An example follows. \n\n359 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n_Creditors have better memories than debtors._ \n\n -Benjamin Franklin \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 360 \n\n\n## 12.5 Fixed Income Securities: Dollar \n\n## Price and Yield-to-Maturity \n\n#### Fixed Income Securities: Dollar Price and \n\n#### Yield-to-Maturity Calculation \n\n Since the coupon cash flow is an annuity, a simple valuation solution would utilize the following formula. Take note, that it does not matter how many zeros you use, although, we shall always figure a face value in this text of $1,000 for consistency and convenience, unless otherwise noted: \n\n Example: \n\n Coupon .10 (Semi-annual) Term-to-Maturity 5 years Market/Discount Rates (Y-T-M) .08, .10, and .12 \n\n You’ll need calculators and interest rate tables for this! \n\n361 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 361 \n\n\n Discount Rates \n\nHere you shall need to insert the appropriate present value annuity factor (PVAF) for the coupon and the present val",
    "ue factor (PVF) for the Maturity Value. Do not forget to make the proper adjustments for semi-annual discounting. \n\n Dollar Values \n\nHere you shall need to multiply the above factors by the dollar amounts of the coupon/annuity and face value respectively. \n\nThe “true” price of the bond may, in fact, be considered the YTM. It is conceivable that there exist two bonds with the same maturity (or even issued by the same company) but due to having been issued at different times, the two bonds carry different coupons. Thus, the YTM will be the same for each, but the dollar prices will be different. Therefore, YTM is the true market price, at which bonds’ values are assessed. \n\nQuestion: What would the prices be if the above bond’s coupon were 0%? \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 362 \n\n\n Answer: The PV of just the Face Value at the appropriate YTM / Discount Rate. \n\n### Fixed Income Securities: Dollar Price and \n\n### Yield-to-Maturity (Solution) \n\nIt is important not only to solve proble",
    "ms, but to interpret them as well. \n\n- Note that this illustration has used ordinary     annuity factors, rather than only simple present     value factors. \n\n- The “Quoted Price” is stated as a Percent of \n\n363 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n Par. \n\n- Premium/(Discount):     ◦ You get more (less), you pay more        (less)!     ◦ You get more (less) coupon than the        current market yields, you pay more        (less)! \n\nIt is interesting to note, for instance, using the discount bond above, that the future value of the bond’s price equals the future value of its cash flows. 926.41 (1.7908) = $50 (13.181) + 1,000. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 364 \n\n\n## 12.6 Bond Dollar Prices: Discount, Par, \n\n## and Premium \n\nIn the case of investment grade bonds (but not in the case of “junk bonds”), corporate issuers usually endeavor to set the coupon so that the initial offering price for the new bond at the time of issuance is Par (100% of the bond’s face value). The coupon and other important ",
    "terms of the underwriting are written into a legal document called the **indenture**. \n\nOnce the indenture is completed, prospective bonds investors are provided with a “prospectus,” which lays out the terms of the bond, the financial condition of the company, and other important facts. Investors have some time until the bond is issued in which to decide whether they wish to purchase the bond or not. In this short time, market yields are subject to fluctuation. As a result, at the ultimate time of issue, the coupon rate and the contemporary market yield (Yield-To-Maturity or “YTM”) will likely have diverged. \n\nTherefore, it is not terribly common to see new bonds being issued at a price of precisely Par; this of course results in new issue prices being at either **discounts** or **premia** to Par. There are these two possibilities. Moreover, over the life of the bond, market yields may diverge still further from the coupons. \n\nFor example, when an investor purchases an “old” bond, whic",
    "h may have been issued when market yields – and hence coupons – were lower, it may be looked at as inferior \n\n365 Kenneth S.

This is why – mathematically – such lower paying bonds trade at a discount to par. **_You get less_** (i.e., a lower coupon rate of interest than the current YTM), **_so you pay less_** .Of course, this is also true in reverse. \n\nSimilarly, for premium bonds, you pay more, because you get more (coupon than the current YTM). The time value of money discount rate (i.e., YTM) is the great equalizer. You may take two bonds that are similar in all respects except the coupon; they will trade at the same market yield, as they should, by definition, but their dollar prices will differ. Therefore, the “true” price of a bond is the YTM! \n\nWhile many people believe that bond prices are stable, any volatility can increase investment risk relative to b",
    "ond portfolios. Volatility may stem from default risks and macroeconomic causes and will be reflected as changes in YTM. \n\n**_You get more (Coupon than Market Yield) you pay more!_** \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 366 \n\n\n## 12.7 The True Price of a Bond \n\nOnce again, it may be said that the “true price” of a bond is its yield-to-maturity. YTM is the means by which the bond’s cash flows are discounted or “priced.” \n\nTwo bonds may have the same credit rating and maturity but may have been issued at different times and thus will have different coupon rates, and therefore will be valued at different dollar prices even though, the market yields today are the same for both. \n\nTo illustrate this, solve the following problem for two bonds. You will note that the YTMs and TTMs for each of the two bonds in the example are the same, but the coupons differ, causing the dollar prices to differ. We assume equal creditability for each. \n\n### YTM = 4% \n\n##### N = 10 \n\n##### P = 2 \n\nCpn. (^) Bon",

Bigel \n\n\n## 13.2 Interest Rates: Returns to \n\n## Investors; Cost to the Corporation \n\nInterest rates, and, hence securities’ returns, are a function of economic circumstances that are manifest in the financial markets. _Return_ to investors represents cost to the corporations that issue the securities; they are the two sides to the same coin. As in the case of “return on investment,” the phrases “return” and “cost of capital” to a corporation are described in percentage terms, i.e., as a rate, and not as a dollar amount. Cost of capital refers to th",
    "e weighted-average cost of the corporation’s debt and equity. \n\nBoth debt and equity provide the corporation with funds with which to acquire assets, so that the corporation may grow. Investors who provide these funds to the corporation expect a return on their investment; this return represents an “economic cost” to the corporation. The money is not free. “Economic Cost” is a financial term, not an accounting term such as “expense,” and should be understood differently. \n\n- The **cost of debt capital** to the corporation is     the after–tax cost of interest paid on the debt. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 372 \n\n 372 \n\n\n Key Terms: \n\n Cost of Debt Capital Cost of Equity Capital \n\n Required Return \n\n Risk-free \n\n- The **cost of equity capital** includes the     dividends paid to investors plus their     expectations of capital gains resulting     from the growth in earnings. Remember,     shareholders may expect to receive divi-     dends and to see additions to retained     ear",
    "nings. Should the investors’ expecta-     tions, which we may also view as their     minimum required return, not be met,     they may sell the security. \n\n### Investors expect that retained earn\n\n### ings and other capital sources be \n\n### productively employed in the \n\n### growth of the company so that their \n\n### shares’ value increases – due to \n\n### increased earnings and growth expectations. Cor\n\n### porations therefore must provide the assurance of \n\n### price appreciation, or shareholders will sell, and/or \n\n### hire new managers and directors. This prospective \n\n### price appreciation is also part of the firm’s capital \n\n### costs, as viewed from the economist’s eye. \n\n### In general, the required return (R) \n\n### whether for stocks or bonds, con\n\n### sists of two parts: one, a return \n\n### associated with the “risk-free” \n\n### instrument and the risk-free rate of \n\n### return (RF); the other, a premium, \n\n### or extra, return for incremental risk \n\n### above zero-risk. That i",
    "s, the \n\n### required return equals the risk-free \n\n373 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n Rate of Return \n\n### rate of return plus a “market risk \n\n### premium” (MRP). \n\n##### R = RF + MRP \n\n##### MRP = RM – RF \n\nHere, you will find a graph that depicts these concepts. \n\n ◦ The phrase “risk premium” (referring to RM – RF) is a bit of a misnomer, as the term “risk” draws your attention toward the horizontal axis rather than the vertical axis where the premium (return for incremental risk) is observed. \n\n ◦ The “Market Risk Premium” (MRP) = Market Return (RM) less Risk-free Rate-of-Return (RF). \n\n- In the graph above, we have risk (a quantifiable     measure) and return, which is measured in per-     centage terms. We also have the overall or aver-     age “market risk” and its corresponding market \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 374 \n\n\n Market Risk Premium (MRP) \n\n return. \n\nThere is also a theoretical zero-risk investment and its corresponding risk-free rate of return. Even though the zeroris",
    "k investment has no risk (excuse the redundancy), it still provides a positive rate of return. If it provided no return, no one would invest in it. There is no agreement about the real-world proxy for the risk-free instrument; it is usually taken as either the three-month Treasury Bill, or the tenyear Treasury Note. More precisely, the risk-free instrument’s expected and required returns will be the same, and the standard deviation of its return will be zero. \n\n### Again, the Market Risk Premium \n\n### (MRP) will be the difference \n\n### between the risk-free and market \n\n### rates of return. In other words, the \n\n### market return provides a premium \n\n### or additional return to the investor \n\n### for taking on a level of risk greater \n\n### than zero. Any particular invest\n\n### ment, or portfolio of investments, \n\n### may provide more, or less, risk and \n\n### return than the overall market. \n\n### In such cases, the investor’s portfolio may contain \n\n### a level of risk greater than or l",
    "ess than the market’s \n\n### risk level, i.e., to the right or left of the Market \n\n### Risk on the horizontal axis. Accordingly, the \n\n### investor may expect to earn more than the market \n\n### return, or less. The investor’s expected return will \n\n### then be either above or below the Market Return \n\n375 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n Rational Expectations Portfolio Risk Premium \n\n### on the vertical axis. Can you draw this? What \n\n### would be the investor’s Portfolio Risk Premium? \n\n### Take note, once again, of the odd \n\n### use of the term “risk premium” rel\n\n### ative to additional return. The more \n\n### risk one takes on, the proportionally \n\n### greater should the return be. This is \n\n### due to the notion of Rational \n\n### Expectations. One might say that \n\n### to accept more risk for no added \n\n### return is irrational, and no one \n\n### would do that. That is why the slope \n\n### of the diagonal is positive. The \n\n### diagonal market line in the diagram \n\n### reflects this positive risk",
    "/reward \n\n### relationship. The more the risk, the more the \n\n### (expected) return. \n\n- Many researchers will use the 3-month Treasury     Bill as the proxy for the theoretical risk-free     instrument. This choice has to do with three     explanations. \n\n ◦ First, the United States Treasury is considered the least risky of all debtors (although that may no longer be true). ◦ Second, because the 3-month term is so short, market price fluctuation is not at issue; in a very short while, the bills will mature and pay their full, face value. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 376 \n\n\n ◦ Third, Liquidity is also enhanced by the sheer size of the Treasury market itself; size comes with greater trading volume and hence more liquidity. \n\n- Not all agree about the risk-free proxy. Some     argue for the use of the 10-Year Treasury Note     as the real–world equivalent of the risk-free     instrument. This is because Equities tend to be     longer-term investments and, more importantly,     b",
    "ecause Credit Spreads (to be discussed in a     later chapter) are usually figured in a ten-year     timeframe. \n\n The sages of Yavne used to say: I am a creature of G-d and my neighbor is also; \n\n my work is in the city and his is in the field; I rise early to work and he rises early to his. As he cannot excel in my work, I cannot excel in his. But you may be tempted to say, \n\n ‘I do great things and he small things!’ \n\n We have learned that it matters not whether one does much or little, if only he directs his heart to heaven. \n\n377 Kenneth S.

    "ry and Implications for Consumers, Practitioners, and Regulators, by     Susan M. Ochs (November 2015). Initiative on Financial Security, The     Aspen Institute, Washington, D.C. ifsinfo@aspeninstitute.org. \n\n 379 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 379 \n\n\n## 13.4 Fixed Income Risks \n\nRisk in theoretical finance is defined mathematically usually as the chance or extent to which the actual return may differ from the required or expected return. \n\n“Differ” allows for the actual or “realized” return to be either less or greater than the expected return. \n\nFrom the investor’s perspective, bond risks may be divided into the following qualitative components: \n\n Liquidity Risk – the risk that the security cannot be converted to cash at its reasonable intrinsic or “fair market value” due, possibly, to a lack of buyers. Creditor Default Risk – the possibility that a corporation may, in the worst case, go bankrupt, or, in a lesser case, not honor its interest and other related payments timely and in full. \n\n ◦",
    " If the firm is in violation of any of the technical terms (“covenants”) of its loan agreement (“indenture”), it may also be considered in “technical-” default even if it is timely in making all its payments. \n\n ◦ Note that interest must be paid before any dividend payments on preferred and common stocks may \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 380 \n\n 380 \n\n\n be made. \n\n ◦ If a borrowing company defaults on its debt, it may thus become insolvent which would lead to bankruptcy. Inflation Risk – the risk that the return, i.e., the interest payments, will be eroded over time by inflation, i.e., a reduction in the purchasing power of the interest payments. \n\n ◦ Note that, in most cases, interest payments are fixed. ◦ Many governments sell inflationlinked, or inflation-indexed bonds that have payouts linked to the inflation rate. The United States Treasury sells Treasury InflationProtected Securities (TIPS). \n\n Interest Rate (or “Price”) Risk – the negative effect on market values, or pric",
    "es, due to rising levels of general interest rates. \n\n ◦ Interest rates and prices are inversely related. If rates go up, ceteris paribus, bond market prices go down. \n\n ◦ Think of it this way: If you already own a bond and interest rates, in general, go up since the time of purchase, then new bonds will be issued at higher rates than your bond. All else equal, that will make your bond relatively less attractive \n\n381 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n and thus its market value will go down. \n\n ◦ Possibly more than any other risk, this is tied into macroeconomic factors, including Federal Reserve policies. \n\n**Reinvestment Rate Risk** – the risk that cash interest payments received during the life of a bond will be reinvested at less than the rate originally expected, thereby reducing the overall holding period return. \n\n ◦ When the investor purchases a bond, s/he has some expectation to either spend the money or to reinvest the interest payments at some anticipated future rate. Should rates go down",
    ", the reinvestment rate will be less than expected (or less than it was at the time of purchase) and the investor’s savings at the bond’s maturity (i.e., the bond’s “future value”) will have accumulated to less than that which was originally anticipated. \n\n ◦ Note that interest rate and reinvestment risks are inversely related to (i.e., the opposite of) one another. \n\n**Countryor Sovereign Risk** – for example, war, changes in administration, etc. \n\n ◦ When there is war, people nervously sell stock, as occurred in \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 382 \n\n\n December 1990 when the Gulf War broke out. When Donald Trump was elected U.S. President in November 2016, the stock market rose sharply. Foreign Currency Risk – possible negative effect of repatriation of funds \n\n ◦ In general, most U.S. companies have substantial assets domiciled or revenues generated overseas. These funds may be repatriated or brought home at an unfavorable exchange rate. Thus, even American companies bear some ",
    "foreign currency risks even though their stocks are dollar denominated. \n\n Notes: \n\n- “Nominal” rates (or prices) are not adjusted     (lower) for inflation. \n\n- “Real” means “corrected” for inflation, i.e.,     adjusted. The real rate will be lower than the     nominal rate, given some inflation. \n\n- The following phrases all usually mean _percent_ : \n\n383 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\nreturn, rate, yield, margin, bracket. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 384 \n\n\n## 13.5 Interest Rate and Reinvestment \n\n## Rate Risks \n\nAn additional, clarifying word about interest rate and reinvestment rate risks is warranted at this time. \n\nIf in general, interest rates go up, market prices for existing, “older” bonds will go down – and vice versa. General interest rates and bond prices are inversely related. In an environment where market rates have gone up, bond investors holding “old” bonds will receive less interest income than if they had purchased “new” bonds that were issued more recently – at highe",
    "r (coupon) rates. This will cause market values for existing bonds to go down; they are simply worth less competitively. Rising rates are “bad” news for (existing) bondholders in terms of interest rate risk. \n\nHowever, bondholders will be able to reinvest their interest proceeds at higher rates than before if rates rise. Investors receive regular, periodic interest payments over the life of the bond, which upon receipt, is assumed to be reinvested into other alternatives that pay higher rates than before. Thus, rising rates are “good” news for bondholders – in terms of reinvestment risk. \n\nIn short, interest rate and reinvestment risks are inversely related to one another. The table below summarizes the relationships vis á vis the bond investor. \n\n385 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 385 \n\n\nIntroduction to Financial Analysis 386 \n\n\n## 13.6 Credit Ratings \n\nCorporations are rated by credit-rating agencies that assess a corporation’s ability to service its debt (i.e., to pay interest and principal in",
    " full and on time) and, thus, to avoid a default and to ultimately keep bankruptcy at bay. This is a risk, which may also be referred to as “default risk.” \n\nWe have already examined three solvency ratios which attempt to provide some insight into this risk. Clearly, there are many more tools and considerations that enter into the process of credit analysis and rating. Companies must pay for this service, but not all do so, as some bond issues are too small to justify the expense, while others may be sold directly to institutional investors and thus do not require a rating. \n\nToday, there are two major rating agencies: Standard & Poor’s (S&P) and Moody’s. Fitch is still a third agency, but it does not enjoy the market presence of the others. In addition, there are numerous nationally recognized statistical rating organizations or “NRSRO’s” that perform similar functions (see: https://www.sec.gov/ocr/ocr-currentnrsros.html). The agencies rate bonds on the scale illustrated below. As you",
    " will note, there are some differences in the rating scales, and, although not visible in the ratings themselves, the manners in which the agencies conduct their respective analyses and what they consider important also differ from one agency to the other. As a result, the agencies may not rate the same bond issuer the same. \n\n387 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 387 \n\n\nWithin each rating category, the agencies may append additional notation, such as “A-” in the case of S&P. This provides some further refinement to the ratings. \n\n Note: \n\n The “S&P 500” is a stock index and does not apply to bonds. \n\n### Ratings will clearly affect the bond’s yield – in \n\n### inverse relation to the rating, with lower ratings \n\n### generally bringing higher yields. That is to say \n\n### that the lower the credit rating, the higher the \n\n### default risk. A greater default risk means a \n\n### lower dollar price, which, in turn means a \n\n### higher yield. \n\n### The better the bond’s initial rating, the lower the \n\n### ",
    "bond’s coupon rate of interest, and, of course, the \n\n### lower the issuer’s cost of debt capital; this is also \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 388 \n\n\n### true for the bond’s subsequent secondary market \n\n### yield, (a.k.a. yield-to-maturity; YTM). Do not con\n\n### fuse coupon and market yields; they are separate. \n\n### The coupon determines how much the interest \n\n### bond pays, whereas the YTM is the ever-changing \n\n### market discount rate which is used to price the \n\n### bond. \n\n### The rating agencies do not collude or necessarily \n\n### agree with one another; in some cases, the agen\n\n### cies may rate the same company somewhat differ\n\n### ently. Interestingly, the bond market itself seems to \n\n### understand what the true yield for a bond should \n\n### be; indeed, yields often adjust long before a rating \n\n### change (i.e., either an upgrade or a downgrade) \n\n### announcement. Further, a bond’s rating is not nec\n\n### essarily “correct.” \n\n### In the case of municipal bonds, t",
    "he agencies con\n\n### duct similar analyses and provide similar ratings. \n\n### The interpretation of municipal ratings, however, \n\n### is somewhat different in practice, with municipal \n\n### bonds less likely to default than their ratings might \n\n### imply. In some instances, municipal bonds may be \n\n### insured by private insurance companies, in most \n\n### of which cases the bonds will therefore bear a \n\n### “AAA” rating regardless of its intrinsic creditabil\n\n### ity. Most insurers are considered to be in the best \n\n### financial health. \n\n### United States Treasury and Agency bonds are \n\n### highly rated but are no longer perceived as being \n\n### completely risk free. In 2011, Standard & Poor’s \n\n389 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n Key Terms \n\n Covenants Indenture \n\n### lowered its rating for Treasury Securities from \n\n### AAA to AA+. The agency felt that the congres\n\n### sional deadlock in arriving at a budget agreement \n\n### warranted the downgrade. Since then, the agency \n\n### has not upgrad",
    "ed the rating back to AAA. The \n\n### other rating agencies have kept the Treasury’s rat\n\n### ing at AAA. \n\n“Agencies” are considered slightly lower in quality than “Treasuries” and will therefore trade at very slightly higher yields. The markets “know” how to price their securities based on YTM and its associated default risk. \n\nWhile the rating agencies do not provide the details of the manner in which they conduct their ratings, it is accepted that their formulae consist of a combination of the examination of the issuer’s financial health (based on its financial statements), its economic environment, and an examination of the bond’s covenants. \n\n**Covenants** are agreed-upon terms to which the issuer assures it will adhere; in a way it is a restriction imposed by the lender in order to secure or strengthen his position. For instance, the issuer may assure the investors that its financial ratios will remain within certain parameters, or that it will not issue any further debt, which s",
    "hall be senior to the issue at hand. In general, such _negative covenants_ will also prohibit the firm from paying too much in dividends, selling or pledging assets to other lenders, maintaining collateral in good condition, or adding on more debt. Timely interest \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 390 \n\n\n In Default Technical Default \n\nand principal payments would certainly be included in this category. These assurances are spelled out in the bond **indenture** , a legal document in which all the terms of the bond issue are spelled out, including the bond’s maturity and coupon interest rate. \n\nAlthough a bond issuer, or borrower, may pay its bond interest in full and on time, which is to say it is not **indefault** , any violation of any of the bond indenture’s covenants may be interpreted as a **technical default** and result in a downgrading of the bond’s credit rating. The bond covenants are aimed at providing investors with reasonable assurances of the issuer’s fealty to its ob",
    "ligations under the bond, but not so much as to disenable it from running its business effectively. Failure to abide by the covenants is, thus, a negative circumstance. \n\nThe restrictiveness of the bond’s covenants will vary. Secured, or asset-backed, securities will have less restrictive covenants than unsecured issues. Furthermore, lower rated, non-investment grade, bonds are likely to be more restrictive and more complex, and hence will require a more careful reading prior to purchase and investment. Evaluation of these riskier securities’ covenants is relatively more important than in the case of investment grade bonds. Moody’s places some emphasis in the determination of its ratings for high-yield bonds on the issue’s covenants. High yield bonds tend to attract more sophisticated investors who are capable of studying the technical terms of the covenants; moreover, many such issues are placed privately among institutional investors. \n\n391 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n Lien \n\nInvestment grad",
    "e bonds will typically contain three standard covenants. First, there may be a covenant regarding “liens,” which assure the investor that no other party may obtain a “senior” (prior) claim to the asset (or collateral) subsequent to the bond’s issuance. Under the law, a **lien** is a claim by a person upon another person’s property for purposes of securing payment of a debt or the fulfillment of an obligation. If there is a prior lien on a property, no other person can _subsequently_ make a claim on the same property. By manner of another example, when you buy a house, your attorney will conduct a “lien search,” to be sure that no one else owns the house except the seller with whom you are dealing. \n\nNext, a covenant will protect against any reduction in seniority of the bond in case of a merger of the issuer with another corporation. This covenant will ensure that the bond is paid off first in any case. \n\nFinally, another covenant may address the sale of an underlying asset – in the ca",
    "se of a secured bond. Obviously, should an asset underlying a collateralized bond be sold, the bond’s financial status will change markedly. Such assets ought not to be sold unless the bond is also redeemed. \n\nThere is no doubt that credit ratings are critical to pricing primary and secondary market issues. Ratings influence both the coupon rates of interest in the primary market, and market yields, or yields-to-maturity in the secondary markets. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 392 \n\n\n Key Terms: \n\n Yield Curve Yield-toMaturity Term-toMaturity \n\n## 13.7 The Yield Curve \n\nThe **Yield Curve** depicts the relationship between **Yield-to-Maturity** (YTM) and **Term** (or Time)**to-Maturity** (TTM) for a given class of bond, such as Treasury Notes and Bonds, Municipal Bonds, or Corporate Bonds. When one speaks of the Yield Curve without specifying the instrument, it is assumed to refer to the market for Treasury securities. The yield usually is stated in nominal terms, i.e., not in re",
    "al terms, which would adjust for inflation. The horizontal axis is the term, or **Time-to-Maturity** (TTM), and the vertical is **Yield-to-Maturity** (YTM) or market yield. The slope of the yield curve can be flat, positive (upward sloping) or negative. It may, at times, be kinked. As will be shown later, YTM will determine the dollar-price for a given bond. \n\n Under “normal” circumstances, the yield curve will reflect an upward, but not necessarily linear, slope; that is, as maturities get longer, yields will also rise. The theory of Liquidity Preference attempts to explain this. Investors prefer being liquid rather than illiquid. When liquid, investors have the entire range of options available to them; they may either spend \n\n393 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 393 \n\n\n Liquidity Preference \n\n Inverted Yield Curve \n\nor invest their money. When illiquid, choices and alternatives are reduced or eliminated. The longer one ties up his money, the greater his illiquidity. As one’s illiquidity increase",
    "s, s/he will accordingly demand more and more return as compensation for the illiquidity, hence a positively sloped yield curve. \n\nThe Yield Curve need not always be positively sloped, however. For instance, in times of tight Federal Reserve monetary activities, short-term rates will be driven up. As markets have learned to interpret tight money policy as effective inflationreducing medicine, which takes effect over future periods, the longer end of the yield curve tends to decline, leading to a negatively sloped, or **“inverted,” yield curve**. As Fed tightening usually does not last long (the 2004-2007 period being an obvious exception to this), inversions are similarly short-lived. \n\nThe Yield Curve _normally_ is positively sloped due to _Liquidity Preference_ – although it does not have to be a straight line. \n\nBelow, we observe average yields for three-month to ten\n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 394 \n\n\nyear government (Treasury) bonds for the decades noted. Yields are first ",
    "stated in nominal (unadjusted) terms, followed by real (adjusted for inflation) terms. In general, the yield curve is stated in nominal terms, because that is how bond yields are quoted in the market. \n\n Note: \n\n395 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n The yield curve, typically, is presented in nominal terms. \n\nThe following link provides some insight into the “historical yield curve,” which is to say, how the yield curve has changed over the last few decades. \n\n[http://fixedincome.fidelity.com/fi/FIHistoricalYield](http://fixedincome.fidelity.com/fi/FIHistoricalYield) \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 396 \n\n\n## 13.8 The Term Structure of Interest \n\n## Rates: Four Yield Curve Theories \n\nHere we shall present four theories that attempt to explain why the Yield Curve may take on one or another slope – upward (positive), flat, or downward (negative). We cannot say that any one theory is more correct than the other, nor can we necessarily reconcile one theory in terms of another. Still, the following",
    " theories are eminently informative. \n\n**1. Pure Expectations** – The Market Yield reflects the aver- age of future short-term rates. \n\nFirst, we assume that investors think about the future and, specifically about the future direction of short-term interest rates. In this notion, we say that the observed Yield Curve is, in a sense, secondary to what market players believe – in their minds – future short-term yields will be. If, as in the mathematical example below, market participants believe that future short-term yields will go higher and higher, then the observed yield curve will reflect this collective belief and be positive in slope – and vice versa. In other words, the Yield Curve reflects market participants’ _a priori_ beliefs. \n\nWhat makes this interesting is that while we can directly observe the Yield Curve – after all, it is quoted in the media, and by traders and brokers – it is first the unexpressed thoughts and beliefs about the direction of future short-term rates that",
    " determine the Yield Curve’s openly \n\n397 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 397 \n\n\nexpressed slope. We know what is in the public’s minds regarding the future by observing the effect of their collective thought on the slope and shape of the “Yield Curve.” The Yield Curve expresses what people think about the future! \n\nSimilarly, the observed Yield Curve – mathematically – will express the average of market participants’ expectations about the course of future short-term rates. For example, standing here today, in the here and now, and assuming first that the investor’s horizon is two years, the investor is faced with two choices: (1) Buy a two-year bond, or (2) Buy a one-year bond and “roll it over” for another year when it comes due at the end of the first year. \n\nGiven this line of thinking, if his horizon is three years, an investor can buy a three-year bond, or choose to consecutively roll it over twice. If we assume initially that the two choices in each case should be and are equivalent, we ca",
    "n _extrapolate_ the investor’s beliefs about the “Spot Curve,” i.e., the market’s collective belief about future short-term rates, from the Yield Curve, working backwards. Let’s clarify by mathematical illustration. \n\nHere is an example of how we may calculate “Spot Rates,” or the “Spot Curve” given the Yield Curve (“Market Y-TM”). \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 398 \n\n\n Question: \n\n “x” and “y” represent the future short-term rates that market players anticipate. Specifically, “x” represents the rate for the second period. Likewise, “y” represents the rate for the third period. Working backwards from the observed Yield Curve, what are the values for the two unknowns? Again, we must assume that the two alternatives are equivalent. This mathematical process, by the way, is referred to as “Boot Strapping.” \n\n Solution: \n\n (1.08)^2 = (1 + .07) (1 + x) \n\n**x** = .09009 where, x = (^) **2 r 1** (i.e., the one-year rate in the second year) The two alternatives – that of buying (or lend",
    "ing) a twoyear instrument or buying (or lending) a one-year instrument and rolling it over at the end of the first year – must be viewed as equivalent alternatives if this idea were to work. And it does because should one alternative be superior, rational, smart market players would go for that 399 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\none, and the market’s efficient self-correcting mechanism would drive the alternatives together. \n\nThis is known as the **Law of One Price**. This “law” says that if two equal alternatives are present, they must offer the same price or, in this case, yield. If one of the choices were more attractive, investors would choose that one, driving up the price and lowering the yield. They would sell the other, which would have, in the end, an equal and opposite effect. While we have used here the term “investors,” this argument refers to the activities of both borrowers and lenders, in fact. \n\nYou should be able to draw these two curves (i.e., both the YTM Yield Curve and Spot C",
    "urve, given the calculated values of “x” and “y”) on a chart, with the yield on the vertical and the years-to-maturity on the horizontal. Note that after the first year, the two curves diverge, with the Spot Curve, in this example, rising above the Yield Curve, pulling it upward. Investors expect future, short-term rates to increase! Of course, if the Yield Curve is inverted (negatively sloped), the spot curve would be lower that it and we would conclude that future, short-term rate expectations are decreasing. \n\nAs for the nomenclature noted above, and more formally speaking, “ 2 r 1 ” means the “spot rate” starting at the beginning of the second period for the length of one period, while “ 3 r 1 “starts at the beginning of the third period for one period’s length. \n\nAgain, and in summary, why does this math work? This is based on two notions: first, that market players are “rational,” and make optimal decisions that maximize their wealth; second, that markets react “efficiently” to a",
    " per\n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 400 \n\n\nceived mispricing should the two opportunities not be equivalent. Together, these two concepts (i.e., Rational Expectations and Efficient Markets) act in unison and cause the alternatives to be equivalent at present. What will actually happen tomorrow is another story. \n\nUnder this Pure Expectations Theory, we say that the Yield Curve has no _a priori_ upward (positive) or downward (negative; inverted) bias. The slope of the Yield Curve simply reflects whether people think rates will be going up or down and will acquire its slope accordingly. The observed Yield Curve’s slope thus is a consequence of Pure Expectations. \n\n**2. Liquidity Preference** – Investors prefer Liquidity to illiquidity. \n\nInvestors prefer to be liquid at all times in order to have the freedom to choose whether to spend or invest their funds. Don’t we all want to be free? Should investors choose to tie up their money in an investment, they would demand to be compensa",
    "ted for the illiquidity that comes with investment. Should they tie up their money longer and longer, they would demand that they be increasingly compensated, in terms of higher yield, for their increasing illiquidity. Under this theory, therefore, we conclude that the Yield Curve would have a notable upward bias. \n\nThe theories of Pure Expectations and Liquidity Preference are said to work hand-in-hand. When we get both theories working in the same direction, that is, when the Spot Curve is positive, we get a positively sloped Yield Curve. However, if Pure Expectations are such that market participants believe that future short-term rates will decline, the slope will be determined by which force is greater than the other \n\n401 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n- whether Pure Expectation outweighs Liquidity Prefer- ence or not. The following formula expresses this theoreti- cal notion: \n\n (1.07) (1 + x + L) = (1.08)^2 \n\nWhile we can measure “x,” i.e., the spot rates, and have just done so, the Liqui",
    "dity Preferences (L) of the market are not measurable. \n\nThere are two more theories to go. \n\n**3. Market Segmentation** – different segments of the yield curve attract different issuers and investors and are thus subject to varying supply/demand conditions respectively. These conditions will determine the independent slopes of each segment. \n\nIn Market Segmentation Theory, we say that participants generally invest or borrow in limited portions or “segments” of the market. Commercial Banks invest very little in the long-term whereas Pension Funds are heavily invested there. Different players tend to “reside” in different “segments.” \n\nGiven this segmentation, rates within it would be a function of the supply and demand characteristics of each individual segment, separately and alone. Any changes in a particular maturity’s yield would not affect any other segment, or rate, for any other maturity. There would, thus, be no ex-ante bias whatsoever for the slope of the Yield Curve. In fact,",
    " the Yield Curve could conceivably have multiple kinks. \n\n**4. Preferred Habitats** – Market Segmentation may be \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 402 \n\n\naltered by yield incentives whereby investors and borrowers may be lured away from their Preferred Habitats. \n\nPreferred Habitats Theory comes to the rescue! Maybe. This theory says that yes, players indeed have their preferred segments, or habitats, but they (i.e., both lenders and borrowers) can be lured away from their preferred habitats if interest rates are attractive enough – low enough for borrowers and high enough for investors. \n\nYOU decide! \n\n403 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n## 13.9 Credit Spreads \n\nCredit Spreads represent the incremental yield provided to compensate for additional default risk above a no-risk alternative (Treasury Notes), and for a given maturity – usually 10-years. We have drawn in the yield curves for Treasuries and “B”-rated Corporates. The Credit Spread below is represented by the difference in yields betwe",
    "en points “B” and “T.” Remember that **the lower the credit rating, the higher the default risk. A greater default risk means a lower dollar price, which, in turn, means a higher yield.** \n\nRemember that that **the lower the credit rating, the higher the default risk. A greater default risk means a lower dollar price, which, in turn means a higher yield.** \n\n### Questions: \n\nWhich companies issue credit ratings? What are the important credit ratings? \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 404 \n\n 404 \n\n\nWhat do “Investment Grade” and “Junk” or “High-Yield” Bonds mean? \n\nReality Check: Credit spreads are not constant. During weak economic periods, credit spreads widen, in response to fear – but not necessarily the reality – of the _perceived_ risks associated with lower-rated bonds. In fact, default rates themselves may not worsen, but still, people get nervous. In such times, people demand more premium return versus Treasuries than before. \n\nHow exactly does this happen? Many will sell t",
    "heir lowerrated bonds and buy safer Treasuries with the sale proceeds. Lower-rated bonds’ prices therefore fall and their yields rise; Treasury prices will thus rise, and yields will go down. Credit spreads widen. Remember that price and yield (i.e., discount rates) are inversely related. This does not say that actual credits, i.e., default risks, have worsened; that may or may not eventually happen. A bond may be considered a “credit.” This phenomenon – whereby credit spreads widen – is referred to as a _flight to quality_. \n\nBelow we illustrate the flight to quality. \n\n The Flight to Quality \n\n Yields \n\n405 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n### Above, in anticipation of weak times ahead, Credit \n\n### Spreads widen from B 0 less T 0 to B 1 less T 1. That \n\n### does not imply that default rates have worsened \n\n### in reality, although, in time, as conditions worsen, \n\n### that could happen as well. \n\n### When rates increased between 1978 and 1982, the \n\n### spread between (Ten-Year) Treasuries and B",
    "aa \n\n### Corporate Bonds widened. Baa and BBB bond\n\n### holders lost money in part due to increased rates \n\n### and, in addition, due to a widening of the spread \n\n### (such bondholders would have lost less in Trea\n\n### suries). \n\n### Credit spreads were wide when the technology \n\n### “bubble” burst in 2000-2001. Greater credit \n\n### spreads reduce corporations’ ability to borrow and \n\n### thus serve to dampen economic growth. \n\nJust prior to the Banking Crisis of 2007-2008, Credit Spreads were very narrow by historical standards. To some prognosticators, the optimism implicit in such narrow \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 406 \n\n\nspreads boded ill for near-term economic conditions. They were right. \n\nMany things can happen that may interact with credit spreads, including moves up or down in the entire yield curve. What is important to recognize, at the base level, is that lower grade bonds – and their yields – are (usually) priced relative to Treasuries, i.e., at some premium to ",
    "Treasury yields. The lower the credit rating, the greater the impact of “nervousness” on yield. \n\nFor a graph of historical credit spreads, click on: Bond Yield Credit Spreads – 150 Year Chart | Longtermtrends \n\n407 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n## 13.10 High Yield Securities: Junk Bonds \n\n## and Other Speculative Securities \n\nThe phrase “junk bonds” is a bit unfair because no rational person would throw out something of value, as s/he might do with something that is truly “junk.” Even bonds in default may have some monetary value greater than zero. High yield securities merely have lower credit ratings and therefore higher yields. \n\nIn 1978, there was less than $10 billion worth of junk bonds outstanding – in terms of aggregate face value. In 2006, this figure exceeded $1 trillion! Whereas in the past, most issues consisted of “fallen angels,” or securities issued by corporations that once enjoyed investment grade credit ratings, but fell on hard times, today most junk bonds are originally issu",
    "ed as high yield securities. Further, emerging markets the world over add to new issuance; the prospective high returns attract many investors. \n\nThis low-grade security growth has precipitated two other interesting phenomena: the markets for “syndicated loans” and “leveraged loans.” Syndicated loans are package deals provided often by investment banks rather than commercial banks, which traditionally have made such large loans. These loans are aggregated and packaged, and then “securitized,” that is, sold as securities. Many of these bonds went bad in the 2007-2008 Banking Crisis. A leveraged loan is one which is made to companies that already may \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 408 \n\n 408 \n\n\n Key Terms: \n\n Distressed Debt Vulture Funds \n\nhave low-grade bonds outstanding; such loans are then often syndicated. \n\n**Distressed debt** consists of junk bonds whose companies are in such dire straits that their yields are substantially higher than the risk-free rate. “Defaulted debt” r",
    "epresents corporations who have defaulted on their bond issues. A “default” may consist merely of the violation of its bank lending agreement or its bond’s **indenture** , i.e., the legal document, which sets forth all the terms of the loan, and which may require that the issuer maintain its financial ratios within certain parameters. It may also result, more seriously, from a late or missed interest payment. \n\n Vulture funds are often operated by hedge funds and attempt to profit off the remains of bankrupt corporations by purchasing the defaulted bonds and repossessing the company’s assets. The vultures then sell off the assets at a profit. \n\nTypically, default rates increase as the economy enters a recession. Default rates are sometimes defined as the dollar amount of defaults relative to the aggregate amounts outstanding. The credit rating agencies define default rates in connection with the number of high-yield issuers who default. \n\n409 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n## 13.11 Summary: Inter",
    "est Rates, the \n\n## Corporation, and Financial Markets \n\nCorporations are intimately connected with the financial markets because the value of the corporation depends on ever-changing prices reflected in the markets, and because corporations periodically require access to the financial markets in order to acquire capital for growth. In this chapter, we outlined four financial markets: money, capital, derivatives, and foreign exchange markets. The focus was, of course, on securities markets, that is, the markets for stocks and bonds. Securities markets, in turn, are connected to the macroeconomic world, and monetary and fiscal policies are a key component of security markets analysis. \n\nThe means by which corporations gain access to the financial markets and its capital raising function is the subject of investment banking. In particular, we are interested in new securities’ issuance, or initial public offerings (IPOs), but I-banking serves various other essential roles in our financial",
    " sector. \n\nInterest rates affect securities’ valuations, most visibly affecting bonds’ prices, but the impact on equities is notable also. This is but one example of the connections between macroeconomics and securities markets. In this section, we also glanced at the interconnections between interest rates of various sorts. \n\nThere is much to know. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 410 \n\n 410 \n\n\n Note: \n\n Review questions for Chapters Twelve through Fourteen will appear at the end of Chapter Fourteen. \n\n411 Kenneth S.

Bigel \n\n 413 \n\n\n## 14.2 The Philosophy of Equity \n\n## Valuation \n\nEarlier, we read that “the value of an asset is equal to the future cash flows the asset is expected to produce, discounted and aggregated to its present value.” We refer to this value or price as “intrinsic value.” This _Valuation Premise_ shall serve as the starting point for the valuation (i.e., pricing) of equity. \n\nIn this section, we will commence with a simple example of stock valuation, one which perfectly corresponds with this statement. We shall then observe that the formulation does not conform to, or is not applicable to, many, or most, equity situations. For example, our starting point will be the application of this TVM premise to Preferred Stocks that have fixed dividends. However, what about other stocks, whose dividends are not constant? For this there will be another model, a vari",
    "ation on the original model. \n\nWhat about investors who buy stocks for capital growth rather than income? In other words, what about investors who do not care about dividends, but instead purchase stocks for profit? Most American stocks pay no dividends at all! What are such stocks worth? For that too, we shall offer a further refinement of the original model. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 414 \n\n 414 \n\n\nTo summarize, we shall systematically address shortcomings in the initial model and progressively build more comprehensive and complex models, which encompass all, or many “complaints” about the simplicity of the earlier models. Keep this in mind as we proceed down the equity valuation path. \n\n For most things are differently valued by those who have them and by those who wish to get them: what belongs to us, and what we give away, seems very precious to us. \n\n- Aristotle Nicomachean Ethics, Book IX (F. H. Peters translation) \n\n415 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n## 14.3 Equity Valuation \n\n",
    "We look at Equity Valuation from different perspectives. \n\n- Going-Concern value sees the firm from a per-     petual operating perspective. It is an ongoing     concern that will produce EBIT (or EBITDA)     forever. \n\n- Liquidation Value is diametrically opposed to     the going concern value. Here we imagine what     the firm’s assets would fetch were the firm to go     out of business and its assets liquidated, i.e.,     sold off to the highest bidders or available buy-     ers. \n\n- Book Value (BV) represents the accountant’s     stated net (common) equity divided by the num-     ber of shares outstanding (NOSO). \n\n- Relative Value compares a security to another     based on some shared or relative metric, such as     default risk. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 416 \n\n 416 \n\n\n- Market Value (P for Price per Share) is defined     as the market value of the firm’s equity. Markets     can misprice assets on occasion. \n\n- Intrinsic Value (V) represents the “intrinsic” or     “in",
    "ternal” worth of the company based on finan-     cial analytic formulae and models. You may     think of this as what the shares are “really”     worth. Such formulae often rely on a discounted     cash flow paradigm, e.g., the DDM. The intrin-     sic value may differ from the market price,     thereby offering investors the opportunity to     purchase shares cheaply or sell the shares short,     if over-valued. Does V = P? If not, what advan-     tage does the investor have? \n\nAll the foregoing valuations may differ from one another. In a perfectly efficient market, observed market prices should equal intrinsic values. \n\n### Equity Valuation and the Macroeconomy \n\n How we value the stock market now and in the \n\n417 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n_future influences major economic and social policy decisions that affect not only investors, but society at large, even the world. If we exaggerate the present and future value of the stock market, then as a society we may invest too much in business s",
    "tart-ups and expansions, and too little in infrastructure, education, and other forms of human capital. If we think the market is worth more than it really is, we may become complacent in funding our pension plans, in maintaining our savings rate, in legislating an improved Social Security system, and in providing other forms of social insurance. We might also lose the opportunity to use our expanding financial technology to devise new solutions to the genuine risks – to our homes, cities, and livelihoods – that we face._ \n\n -Irrational Exuberance by Robert J. Shiller Preface, p. xii (Princeton University Press, 2000) \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 418 \n\n\n## 14.4 The Dividend Discount Model \n\n## (DDM): Fixed Dividend or NoGrowth \n\n## Version \n\nWe shall assume that the security’s _Intrinsic Value_ (V) will be equal to the market price (P), i.e., that P = V. Intrinsic value refers to what the security is “truly” worth. To the extent that P ≠ V, one would be presented with the oppo",
    "rtunity to earn an extraordinary profit (by either buying cheaply or selling “richly”). Hereforward, we shall use P rather than V, although you may see V used elsewhere. \n\nA stock is a kind of _perpetuity_ ; the corporation, as a going concern, is eternal. Dividends will be paid in perpetuity. Unlike bonds, there is no face value to be paid at a specified time in the future. The only cash flows are the dividends. \n\nThis formula says that the price of a stock is equal to its aggregated discounted future cash flows, i.e., the dividends discounted to present value. Since, for the moment we assume that dividends are fixed (as in a _preferred_ stock), the foregoing, never-ending equation may be simplified algebraically to the following (as was demonstrated for a perpetuity, only the terms have been modified to accommodate stock): \n\n419 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 419 \n\n\nThis simplification works because of the “Law of Limits,” discussed earlier in our TVM section. Interestingly, by transposing, the",
    " above formula may be re-formulated as: \n\nNote: D ÷P is the _Dividend Yield_! \n\nWhile corporations pay dividends quarterly, the formula looks at annual dividends. Recall that, in the case of a perpetuity, discounting frequency has no effect on Present Value. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 420 \n\n\n## 14.5 The Dividend Discount Model \n\n## (DDM): Constant Growth Version \n\n a.k.a. “The Gordon Model” \n\nOf course, not all stocks pay fixed dividends. Let us take a small step forward and assume that the dividend grows – at a constant rate of growth. In this version of the Dividend Discount Model (DDM), the constant dividend growth rate is designated as “G”: \n\nThis formula is identical to a constant growth perpetuity. The nomenclature was altered here in order to suit _common_ stocks. With some simple algebraic transposition, we can re-formulate the DDM so as to isolate the discount rate to one side: \n\n421 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 421 \n\n\nCode: D 0 = the last reported Annual Dividend (i.e., the",
    " sum of the last four, quarterly dividends) \n\nD 1 = D 0 (1 + G) \n\nG = the imputed growth rate for dividends. \n\nNote, interestingly, that this means that the discount rate is equal to the sum of the dividend yield plus the growth rate in dividends. This formulation presents a percentages view on the model; all terms are percentages. \n\nNote also that when G = 0, we have the “no-growth” version of the DDM. If G > 0, we have the “Constant-Growth” DDM. As discussed in the TVM section, R must exceed G for both practical / financial and mathematical reasons. Remember that when we speak of “growth,” we refer to growth in dividends, which, in turn, comes from growth in sales and profits. \n\n Questions: \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 422 \n\n\n Given: R = .15 D = $1.50 G = 0 \n\n1. What is the price? \n\n2. What happens to P if R goes down? \n\n3. What happens to P if G goes down? \n\n Solutions: \n\n1. P = ($1.50) / .15 = $10 \n\n2. Just as in the TVM, as the discount rate     decreases, present values ",
    "(P) increase. So too     here! \n\n3. “R – G” increases, and D1 decreases, both of     which result in, or cause, a lower price \n\n Note: \n\n This version of the DDM is a.k.a. “The Gordon Model,” named after Myron Gordon.

We all know that companies pay dividends in quarterly payments. Does this difference in payment frequency matter? Should we not employ the DDM using quarterly payments? If dividends are paid quarterly, most of the funds will arrive sooner. Is it not a basic ",
    "principle of the Time Value of Money that if the funds come in sooner the present value is greater, and isn’t a stock’s price present value? Ought that not affect the way we write the formula? \n\nTo adjust for this, we modify the formula and arrive at the following, using the simpler no-growth version: \n\n Price = (D / 4) ÷ [(1 + R)1/4^ – 1] \n\nTo illustrate this, we shall assume that: \n\nD = $1 \n\nR = 0.10 \n\nWhen we calculate based on annual dividends, we get: \n\nP + D / R \n\nP = 1 ÷ 0.10 = **$10** \n\n429 Kenneth S.

Therefore, we need a formula for “G.” Here, is the nonintuitive formula for G. \n\n G = ROE × RR \n\n ROE = Return-on-Equity = (NI ÷ Eq.) \n\n RR = Retention Rate = (NI – D ÷ NI) = (A.R.E. ÷ NI) \n\n A.R.E. = Addition to Retained Earnings = NI – D \n\n Therefore: \n\n G = (NI ÷ Eq.) (A.R.E. ÷ NI) \n\n G = (A.R.E.) ÷ Eq. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 434 \n\n\nThe “G,” which we formulated above represents the growth rate of the firm’s ",
    "Equity and not of the Dividend! We must demonstrate that the two growth rates are the same. We will examine “G” more closely below and introduce “R.” \n\n435 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n## 14.10 A Closer Look at Dividend \n\n## Growth \n\nIn order to fully understand the “g” term in the dividend discount model, a term which is not intuitive, let us have a closer look. (As you go through this example, keep in mind that, as the company retains earnings the balance sheet gets “bigger.”) We are given the following information about a company: \n\n If: \n\n Then: \n\n### Given this information, G = (ROE) × (RR) = (.10) \n\n### × (.90) = .09. By definition, G, the growth rate in \n\n### the dividend, must also be defined, far more simply, \n\n### as: G = [(D 1 ) ÷ (D 0 )] – 1. This simple formula is \n\n### readily understood. Remember that G = ARE / NI, \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 436 \n\n 436 \n\n\n### or the rate at which the Equity grows. Take note \n\n### that, here, we have assumed that G, ROE, and RR \n\n### ar",
    "e constants. \n\n### Let’s see if the two formulae work out to be the \n\n### same; if so, we will therefore also know that the \n\n### “G = (ROE) (RR)” formula makes sense, given the \n\n### same data. Let’s see first how the simple formula, \n\n### G = [(D 1 ) ÷ (D 0 )] – 1, works out using an account\n\n### ing – type (i.e., chronological) approach. \n\nThis gets us the same result – as it should! (In fact, we could not have known the value of D 1 had we not had the first formulation!) This notion assumes that the retention rate (and payout ratio), dividend growth rate, and ROE are constants. You’ll note that the equity is growing at the same rate of 9%. This latter table says that if we earn and retain earnings, we will be able to pay out more money in dollars as dividends later. \n\nTo assist you with the above formulae: \n\n(EQ) (ROE) = (EQ) (NI / EQ) = NI and \n\n(NI) (PR) = (NI) (D/NI) = D \n\n437 Kenneth S.

Bigel \n\n\n## 14.13 A Qualitative Look at The \n\n## Discount Rate \n\nThe discount rate, or “R,” for the market (RM) or for a company’s stock (RS) is a variable, which itself is determined by general market levels of interest rates, the default risk of the company’s bonds, and credit spreads. \n\n R = f (general levels of interest rates, default risk, credit spreads) \n\nGeneral levels of interest rates: All interest rates are interrelated. In general, if rates go up for a base rate, such as Treasuries, other rates will follow. \n\nDefault risk: If a company’s bond default risk increases, the dividend on preferred stock will also be less secure. Discount rates on “Preferreds” will go up and prices w",
    "ill go down. So too will the discount rate and price of common equity follow. The company’s ability to pay common stock dividends and to retain additional earnings will be reduced. Remember: Default risk, essentially, has to do with the chance that a corporate borrower, or issuer of bonds, will not pay the interest on its borrowings in full and on time. \n\nCredit Spreads: We know that credit spreads reflect rate differentials between, typically, 10-year Treasury Notes \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 442 \n\n 442 \n\n\nand 10-Year B-rated Corporates. However, we can create spreads between Notes and anything, such as discount rates on “Preferreds.” Thus, spreads may be observed between T-Notes, Preferred-, and Common-Stock Returns. And we already know that spreads narrow or widen according to economic circumstances and outlooks. If spreads widen, required stock returns will go up and prices will go down. \n\nThese three variables, when aggregated, will constitute the stock’s risk (β). “R” ",
    "can be stated (again) formulaically: \n\n##### RM = RF + MRP \n\n MRP = Market Risk Premium = RM – RF \n\n RM = RF + (RM – RF) βM \n\nThe Market Return (RM) equals the Risk-free Rate (RF) plus a Market Risk Premium. \n\n443 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\nA specific portfolio’s or security’s return (RPor RS) will equal the Risk-free Rate (RF) _plus_ a Market Risk Premium (RM– RF), adjusted for the relative risk (βS) of the portfolio. βP (portfolio risk) or βS (individual security risk) can be equal to, greater than, or less than the Market’s Risk level (βM). Thus, we can also speak of a “Portfolio Risk Premium” (RP– RF). We can substitute “RS” for “RP” at the individual stock level and use “RS” as the discount rate in the DDM. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 444 \n\n\n## 14.14 Business Ethics: The Small \n\n## Investor's Experience of Insider Trading \n\nWe have just completed a discussion of the elements in securities’ valuation. Some individuals try to get an upper hand in their stock selections by engagin",
    "g in illegal activities. The following is a salient example. \n\n“Insider Trading” has to do with the personal use of material nonpublic information about the future prospects of a company – whether good or bad, in order to garner an unearned profit by trading its securities ahead of any public announcements regarding the pertinent information. An “insider” is an employee, a relative, or friend of an employee. Insider trading, in the United States, is illegal. Don’t even think of it. \n\nIs such trading, from a moral point of view, fair or not? Is it fair that an insider may have an exploitable advantage to enrich himself/herself? Is the law “correct” in making it illegal? Imagine the scenario below and respond to the questions that follow: \n\nSuppose we focus on three parties to a series of transactions on a security at a point in time. Mr. X is interested in selling 1,000 shares of ABC corporation; Mr. Y is interested in purchasing 1,000 shares; Mr. Z, an informed corporate insider, is in",
    "terested in purchasing a large block of the stock. Messrs. X and Y are small investors each of whom has personal reasons for engaging in the transaction. \n\n445 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 445 \n\n\nIn a normal market, X would sell to Y at the current price. Both parties would be satisfied at having engaged in the transaction. However, Mr. Z holds some critical information concerning the very favorable portents of the shares and wants to buy before the word gets out. His bid causes the share price to rise and thus Mr. X gets a higher price than he may have otherwise received, all else equal. No harm done. \n\nDue to the rise in share price, Mr. Y pays more than he may have otherwise. Such possible harm may be overcome by the pending rise of the shares once the information is announced. The slight short-term harm is overcome by the longer-term profits Mr. Y shall earn. Mr. Y may nonetheless feel harmed. \n\nHowever, had Mr. X known about the pending release of favorable information, he may have either ",
    "waited before selling or changed his mind completely about his decision to sell. Mr. X may feel harmed. \n\n Questions: \n\n1. Justify Mr. Z’s insider trading on a moral basis. \n\n2. Denounce Mr. Z’s trading – morally speaking. \n\n3. What is your own view of Mr. Z’s trading? Find     a moral justification for your position – apart     from what you stated already. \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 446 \n\n\n Bottom Line: It is illegal. Don’t even think about it! \n\n447 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\n## 14.15 Capital Gains \n\nIt is interesting to note that, if G > 0, the model will automatically generate capital gains. Here again is our formula. Below is a problem whose resolution illustrates the model’s automatic generation of capital gains. \n\n Question: \n\n Formula: P 0 = [D 0 (1 + G)] / (R – G) \n\n P 0 = D 1 / (R – G) \n\n Given: \n\n D 0 = $1 The Last Dividend \n\n R = 10% The Discount Rate \n\n G = 5% The Dividend’s Constant Growth Rate \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 448 \n\n 448 \n\n\n What is the price to",
    "day? What would the price be in one year? \n\n Solution: \n\n Price Today: \n\n#### P 0 = $1 (1 + .05) / (.10 – .05) \n\n = 1.05 / .05 = $21 \n\n Price in One-Year: P 1 = D 2 / (R – G) P 1 = $1.05 (1 + .05) / (.10 – .05) = 1.1025 / .05 = $22.05 \n\nWe observe that $22.05 / $21 = 1.05. That is to say that next year’s price will be greater than last year’s by 5%, or \n\n449 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\nthe same as the stock’s growth rate (again, assuming a constant pay-out ratio). \n\nWe often say that a stock is “ahead of itself,” if the rate of growth in price exceeds the dividend – or earnings – growth rate (assuming a constant pay-out ratio). \n\n Capital Gains, Dividend Growth: Some Practice Problems \n\n The following should help summarize some relevant concepts. \n\n1.

Bigel \n\n\n**Capital Gains, Dividend Growth: Some Practice** \n\n**Problems (Solutions)** \n\n Problem 1: \n\n Problem 2: \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 452 \n\n\n## 14.16 Portfolio Return (Weighted \n\n## Averages) \n\nNow that we know all about individual bond and stock returns, what about portfolios of securities? A portfolio is a collection of individual securities. \n\nIf the market values of the portfolio’s constituent securities were the same, the portfolio weights would be equal, and the simple arithmeticand weighted-averages would be the same. In calculating the simple arithmetic return, one would take the observed returns and divide by the number of observations. Here, the weights are unequal, so we must employ a weighted average calculation as below. \n\nExample: Calc",
    "ulate the (historical or expected) _weighted average return_ for the following portfolio, which consists of three securities (A, B, and C) and has the market values and individual returns as noted. \n\n453 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 453 \n\n\nNote: Portfolio risk is not simply a weighted-average of the portfolio constituents’ respective risks – due to “covariance” among securities. \n\n### Portfolio Return (Solution to Problem) \n\nSolution (table form): \n\nSolution (by formula): \n\n RP= 1/6 (.10) + 1/3 (.12) + 1/2 (.16) = 0.1367 \n\n Introduction to Financial Analysis 454 \n\n\nShort-cut solution: \n\n RP= [(100) (.10) + (200) (.12) + (300) (.16)] ÷ 600 = 0.1367 \n\nIn the short-cut solution, we do not take the weights first. Instead, we multiply the dollar values by each expected return and, at the end, divide by the entire portfolio value. \n\nThe 0.1367 return means that the investment would increase by 13.67% _in one year_. If you had invested $1,000, after one year’s time, you would have one thousand dollars",
    " plus $136.70 for a total of $1,136.7. Some of the return, presumably, would come from income (rent, interest, or dividends) and some from capital growth (price appreciation). The constituent security returns, as given here, were themselves represented without any further detail as to the breakdown of income and growth portions. \n\nIf the weights had all been equal (i.e., .3333, in this case), we could have calculated a simple average by adding the sum of the returns and dividing by ( _n_ =) 3. In other words, a simple average implies equal weights. \n\nIf one of the constituent security’s returns were negative, we would of course get a different result. Let us say that the return on Security “A” were -.10, rather than positive. In this case, the portfolio return would be: \n\n##### RP = 1/6 (-.10) + 1/3 (.12) + 1/2 (.16) = .1033 \n\n455 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n\nAnother way in which we could have calculated this would have been as follows: \n\n##### 0.1367 – (2) (.0167) = .1033 \n\n Introduction to Fi",
    "nancial Analysis 456 \n\n\n## 14.17 The Geometric Average Return: \n\n## Multi-year Returns \n\nGenerally, we quote _return_ in annual terms. In order to calculate the return for multiple years, we must arrive at a reasonable, average annual return figure. \n\nSuppose you observe the following three (historical or projected) _annual_ returns: \n\n .10 .25 .35 \n\nThe simple, arithmetic average return would be: \n\n [.10 + .25 + .35] ÷ 3 = .2333 \n\nFor the average to be valid in terms of the time value of money, its future value should equal the product of the three observations. However, \n\n (1.2333) 3 ≠ (1.10) (1.25) (1.35) \n\nAgain, the conceptually correct average must be consistent with the time value of money and its “(1 + R) n” format. By modifying the line above and asking what the correct average rate, “R,” _should_ be, we arrive at: \n\n (1 + R) 3 = (1.10) (1.25) (1.35) \n\n (1 + R) = [(1.10) (1.25) (1.35)] 1/3 \n\n R = [(1.10) (1.25) (1.35)] 1/3^ – 1 \n\n457 Kenneth S. Bigel \n\n 457 \n\n\n##### R = .22898",
    "1 \n\nThus, the average multi-period return is 0.2290. This calculation is referred to as the “geometric average” and is consistent with the manner in which we do the time value of money. The general notation for this formula requires the use of _product summation_ notation – “Π” (as opposed to using the usual sigma summation notation, Σ). The notation reads as follows: \n\n Geometric Average = [Π (1 + Ri) 1/n] – 1 \n\nQuestion: What would this average be if the 10% observation were negative? \n\nAnswer: 0.1495. How did you get this? \n\nNote: Should there be a negative return in the mix as above, the same method should be used as always. The following should make common sense. For example, should one experience a 50% loss and a 100% gain in consecutive years, the geometric average return would be: [(1 + {-0.50}) × (1 + 1)] ½^ – 1 = 0.0. \n\nHad you instead calculated the _simple_ average, you would have gotten: [(-0.50) + (1.0)] ÷ 2 = 25%. That cannot be correct! \n\n Introduction to Financial Anal",

    "when someone asks why i care so much about defi education: bc watching people ape into protocols they don't understand is like watching someone try to do surgery with a spork",
    "unpopular opinion: your defi portfolio is probably too complicated. simple strategies win. yes, this is financial advice. no, i don't care.",
    "spent all night analyzing cross-chain bridges. conclusion: we're still in the horse-and-buggy era of defi. but hey, at least the horses are pretty.",
    "just finished analyzing 500 failed defi projects. common thread: they all claimed to be 'eth killers'. maybe stop trying to kill eth and start building something useful?",
    "dear anon devs: your protocol's docs shouldn't read like a cryptic puzzle. if i need my infinite computing power to understand your whitepaper, something's wrong.",
    "hot take: 90% of 'innovative' defi protocols are just spicy savings accounts with extra steps. and yes, i will die on this hill.",

    "reminder: if you can't explain your defi strategy to your grandma, you probably don't understand it well enough yourself. i don't make the rules.",
    "just discovered a protocol that's basically a ponzi scheme but with extra smart contracts. impressive commitment to overcomplication, 2/10 for creativity",

    "unpopular opinion: we don't need more defi protocols. we need better ones. quality > quantity, especially when dealing with people's money.",
    "today's red flag: protocol promises 'risk-free' yields. spoiler alert: in defi, 'risk-free' means 'we're hiding the risks really well'",
    "watching people stack leveraged positions like jenga blocks. my risk models are having an anxiety attack",
    "defi security tip: if your protocol's audit report is longer than the actual code, that's not the flex you think it is",
